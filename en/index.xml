<h2 id="green-agile-starts-with-values">Green Agile Starts With Values</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://greenagile.org">Green Agile Guide</a>, we often talk about sustainable practices: impact transparency, a green product backlog, ecological architecture decisions. But all of these methods are ineffective if they aren’t built on a <strong>foundation of values</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s why we’ve placed two guiding principles at the core of the guide:</p>

<h3 id="awareness">Awareness</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding what software really <em>does</em> — technically, ecologically, socially</li>
  <li>Having the courage to name <strong>blind spots</strong> in teams and processes</li>
  <li>Seeing systems in context: Who uses them? What do they really need? What costs arise in 2, 5, or 10 years?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Awareness means not just optimizing locally — but thinking globally.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Making decisions even when they’re uncomfortable or more expensive short-term</li>
  <li>Naming technical debt — instead of ignoring it</li>
  <li>Taking long-term maintainability seriously</li>
  <li>Not delegating sustainability — but <strong>owning it as part of your role</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Responsibility means taking action — even when no one is watching.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-its-more-than-just-technology">Why It’s More Than Just Technology</h2>

<p>Many companies today invest in sustainability initiatives — from green coding to CO₂ compensation. That’s important. But without <strong>internalized values</strong>, it often remains symbolic.</p>

<p>Sustainability needs a culture in which people say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I understand what I’m doing — and I stand by the impact of my work.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s where Green Agile comes in. It’s not about new roles or checklists. It’s about bringing <strong>a new mindset</strong> into existing processes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-can-you-do">What Can You Do?</h2>

<p>Here are some questions you can ask yourself — or your team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where are we missing <strong>transparency</strong> — technically or organizationally?</li>
  <li>Who is <strong>truly responsible</strong> — not just formally, but in reality?</li>
  <li>What decisions would we make differently if we thought <strong>more long-term</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>

<p>Over the next few weeks, I’ll share more elements of the Green Agile Guide in a short blog series — from practical techniques to role models and meaningful metrics. If you’re interested in applying the guide in your organization or contributing your thoughts, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

  <p>Together, we can prove: <strong>Sustainable software doesn’t happen by accident. It’s built by people with awareness and responsibility.</strong></p>

Hardly anyone thinks of software. Yet our digital systems hide a massive, invisible energy and resource footprint. Data centers consume more electricity than entire countries, and poorly optimized software forces hardware to be replaced far too quickly.</p>

<p>This topic has accompanied me for many years. As a <strong>software engineer</strong>, I’ve seen how small design decisions can make huge differences in energy consumption. Later, as an <strong>Agile Coach and RTE</strong>, I supported organizations in steering complex IT landscapes and teams. Again and again, I ran into the same gap: agility brings speed and adaptability – but the ecological dimension was left out.</p>

<p>This is exactly where <strong>Green Agile</strong> comes in.</p>

<h2 id="why-green-agile">Why Green Agile?</h2>

<p>Classical agile methods like Scrum, SAFe, or Kanban focus on delivery capability, customer value, and flexibility. All important values – but they fall short if we exclude long-term responsibility for environment and society.</p>

<p>Green Agile combines the <strong>principles of agility</strong> (transparency, inspection, adaptation) with the <strong>dimensions of sustainability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ecological</strong> – reducing energy consumption, extending hardware lifecycles, mindful use of resources</li>
  <li><strong>Economic</strong> – increasing efficiency, avoiding technical waste, building future-proof IT strategies</li>
  <li><strong>Social</strong> – healthy teams, fair collaboration, ethical awareness in product development</li>
</ul>

<p>Agility without sustainability is short-term. Sustainability without agility often remains theory. Only in combination can teams and organizations truly become future-proof.</p>

<h2 id="the-green-agile-guide">The Green Agile Guide</h2>

<p>To make this connection tangible, I created the <strong>Green Agile Guide</strong>. Inspired by the Scrum Guide, but deliberately extended. It’s not a new framework, not a collection of methods – but a <strong>mindset</strong> that provides orientation.</p>

<p>The Guide describes how teams can integrate ecological, economic, and social responsibility into their way of working, without sacrificing speed or flexibility. It’s about asking better questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the ecological footprint of our architecture?</li>
  <li>How do we measure sustainability alongside time-to-market and business value?</li>
  <li>How do we create structures that work not only for the next quarter but also for the next generation?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outlook--and-my-stance">Outlook – and My Stance</h2>

<p>With my company <strong>mehr.wert</strong>, I support organizations as a <strong>Fractional CTO</strong>. My stance: technology and leadership should not only strive for efficiency and profit, but must also create <strong>more value for the world</strong>. Green Agile is one part of this vision.</p>

<p>I invite you to join the conversation, share your feedback, and help shape the Green Agile Guide. Because only together can we make IT not just faster, but also more sustainable.</p>

<p>In this second part, we turn to the <strong>practical application</strong>: How can <strong>ChatGPT be used in everyday development</strong> to produce <strong>sustainable, energy-efficient code</strong>? We take a closer look at <strong>current research</strong>, analyze the <strong>strengths and weaknesses</strong> of LLMs, and show how these tools can already be tailored for <strong>Green Coding</strong> today—and how to put this <strong>potential to use</strong> right now.</p>

<p>Before diving into specific implementation methods in ChatGPT, we need to ask a fundamental question: <strong>Can a language model like ChatGPT even generate energy-efficient code—and if so, under what conditions?</strong> This potential needs to be confirmed before considering appropriate techniques and contexts for practical use. Let’s take a look at <strong>current research findings</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="can-chatgpt-actually-produce-energy-efficient-code">Can ChatGPT actually produce energy-efficient code?</h3>

<p>The answer is: <strong>Yes—under certain conditions</strong>. But not automatically. A key source here is the study “Generating Energy‑efficient Code with LLMs” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10599">Tom Cappendijk et al., 2024</a>). In a controlled experiment, five large LLMs (including CodeLlama‑70b and DeepSeek‑Coder‑33b) were tasked with solving three different LeetCode problems. The prompts ranged from neutral instructions (“Solve this problem”) to specific phrasing such as “Give me an energy‑optimized solution…” or “Use library functions.”</p>

<p>The study concludes that <strong>energy savings through LLMs are generally possible</strong>—but not consistently. In some test scenarios, certain combinations of model, task type, and <strong>targeted prompting</strong> led to significant improvements in energy efficiency. For example, the use of <strong>efficient library functions</strong> or <strong>optimized loop structures</strong> resulted in savings of up to <strong>60%</strong>. At the same time, there was <strong>no prompt that consistently produced more efficient code</strong>; in some cases, the models even generated considerably less efficient code, especially for more complex tasks.</p>

<p>The decisive factor is <strong>prompting</strong>: Only when the prompt explicitly references energy efficiency or specific coding practices does the <strong>likelihood increase</strong> that the generated solution will be resource-conscious. Without such guidance, the energy efficiency of the output remains <strong>largely unpredictable</strong>.</p>

<p>The study shows: LLMs like ChatGPT <strong>can</strong> generate <strong>energy-efficient code</strong>—if <strong>guided accordingly</strong>. What matters are <strong>clear prompts</strong> and a meaningful <strong>context</strong>. Without them, the potential remains untapped.</p>

<h3 id="ai-powered-refactoring-what-the-research-tells-us">AI-powered Refactoring: What the Research Tells Us</h3>

<p>A major shortcoming of existing approaches is their focus on evaluating AI-generated code. They assess how energy-efficient a given output is—but offer no concrete method for automatically improving existing code. This is where a research team from Purdue University (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09241">Peng et al., 2024</a>) goes a step further: They developed a prototype for an automated <strong>refactoring system</strong>, in which <strong>two LLMs collaborate</strong> to systematically optimize existing code for energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works: A first model (e.g., GPT-4) analyzes the input code and suggests an <strong>optimized version</strong> designed to use fewer resources. A second model evaluates this suggestion—checking for <strong>functional correctness</strong> and measuring actual <strong>energy consumption</strong> using embedded telemetry and runtime data. Based on this feedback, the first model can then <strong>iteratively improve</strong> its suggestions.</p>

<p>The result: In about half of the test cases, <strong>energy consumption was significantly reduced</strong>—sometimes to less than half of the original level. Particularly notable: In several cases, the refactoring suggestions even outperformed what traditional <strong>compiler optimizations</strong> achieved.</p>

<p>This approach clearly highlights the <strong>potential of LLMs in sustainable software maintenance</strong>: Instead of merely generating efficient new code, they could also adapt existing code to meet modern <strong>efficiency standards</strong>—a promising outlook for future tools.</p>

<h3 id="green-coding-guidelines-how-to-train-chatgpt-with-context">Green Coding Guidelines: How to Train ChatGPT with Context</h3>

<p>To unlock the potential of LLMs like ChatGPT for everyday development, several proven strategies are already available. While research shows that LLMs do not inherently produce energy-efficient code, their output can be greatly improved through <strong>targeted prompting</strong> and <strong>contextual guidance</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want ChatGPT to consistently focus on energy efficiency in code generation, there are multiple ways to make that happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Persistent Custom Instructions</b><br />
With custom instructions (accessible via the settings menu in the ChatGPT app, available only for ChatGPT Plus/Enterprise), you can store permanent prompts that are automatically applied in every conversation. <br />
These instructions are used across contexts – regardless of the project or topic at hand.</li>

<li><b>Upload style guides or Markdown files</b><br />
GPT-4 supports file uploads. This allows you to provide your own guidelines directly as input – for example as `green_coding_guidelines.md` – and explicitly ask the model to follow them.</li>

<li><b>Create your own GPTs with system prompts</b><br />
Using the "Explore" feature, you can build specialized GPTs that consistently follow Green Coding goals – including fixed prompts and optional knowledge files.</li>

<li><b>Be clear and structured</b><br />
Rules should be positive, precise, and written in bullet points. Reinforcers such as “always” or “definitely” help the model prioritize effectively.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Good prompting is key</strong>—and sometimes a single sentence is enough to noticeably improve code suggestions. A prompt that has proven effective in practice reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Act as an experienced software developer. Review the following code for performance, maintainability, and energy efficiency. Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement in each of these areas.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This prompt is taken from a practical article by (<a href="https://ashexplained.com/how-to-improve-code-reviews-using-chatgpt/">Ash Explained, 2024</a>) and can be easily adapted. Developers looking to systematically generate or review more efficient code can embed such prompts directly or apply them as persistent settings.</p>

<h3 id="green-coding-checklist-for-embedding-or-uploading">Green Coding Checklist (for Embedding or Uploading)</h3>

<p>Here is a list of Green Coding Principles that can be incorporated in various ways within ChatGPT: directly in prompts, as system instructions in a custom GPT, or as a Markdown file uploaded during a conversation. This checklist can of course be refined or extended for project-specific needs:</p>

<h3> Green Coding Guidelines for Energy-Efficient Software</h3>
<h4> General Principles</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use efficient algorithms &amp; data structures</li>
  <li>Avoid redundant computations</li>
  <li>Apply caching &amp; memoization</li>
  <li>Avoid busy-waiting</li>
  <li>Keep memory usage low</li>
  <li>Parallelize tasks sensibly</li>
</ul>
<h4> Python-Specific</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use vectorized NumPy operations instead of loops</li>
  <li>Prefer generators over lists</li>
  <li>Read files line by line</li>
  <li>Avoid object instantiation inside loops</li>
</ul>
<h4> Java-Specific</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid object allocations in hot loops</li>
  <li>Use streams instead of full data loads</li>
  <li>Prefer primitive types</li>
  <li>Mark constants with <code>final</code></li>
</ul>
<h4> Cross-Technology</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Move loop conditions outside the loop</li>
  <li>Use optimized libraries</li>
  <li>Choose suitable languages/platforms</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Language models like ChatGPT can be a powerful <strong>tool for sustainable programming</strong>—provided they are used strategically. Research shows: <strong>Energy-efficient code does not happen by default</strong>. It requires clear instructions, thoughtful context, and the integration of green coding principles into the development process. By leveraging <strong>custom instructions</strong>, <strong>prompting strategies</strong>, or tailored <strong>style guides</strong>, developers can start using the potential of LLMs for sustainable software development today—reducing resource consumption while improving code quality.

Indeed, modern AI systems are seen as beacons of hope in nearly every field. In <em>medicine</em>, they are expected to detect diseases earlier and help develop new treatments. In the fight against <em>climate change</em>, they promise to optimize the <em>energy sector</em> and <em>mobility</em>. <em>Education</em> could also be transformed by personalized learning systems. And when it comes to <em>climate adaptation</em>, AI is increasingly used to predict extreme weather events, map risks, and help cities adjust their infrastructure to heatwaves. In short: AI is celebrated as a miracle cure for solving humanity’s most pressing problems.</p>

<p>But this euphoric narrative often overshadows a more fundamental issue: While much attention is paid to AI’s energy and resource consumption, a more crucial question remains—<strong>can AI actually create innovation, or is it merely a tool for reassembling existing knowledge?</strong> Today’s systems like GPT-4 are impressive in producing fluent texts, but they draw entirely on pre-existing data. True creative breakthroughs, scientific paradigm shifts, or disruptive ideas still originate from human intuition, curiosity, and experience.</p>

<p>That’s not to ignore the environmental impact: Training large models consumes vast amounts of energy and leaves behind a significant carbon footprint—training GPT-3 alone emitted around <strong>550 tons of CO₂</strong>. And that’s without accounting for the environmental toll of the required hardware: Specialized chips and servers demand enormous resources and materials—often at the expense of ecosystems and communities in mining regions. While some companies are working on more efficient algorithms and sustainable infrastructure, reality still lags behind these ambitions. Without clear ecological guidelines, technological progress risks continuing at the planet’s expense.</p>

<p>The glowing vision of AI as a universal savior begins to look less like a revolutionary shift and more like a reflection of our existing mindset—only faster.</p>

<h2 id="when-ai-becomes-a-technological-miracle-cure">When AI Becomes a Technological Miracle Cure</h2>

<p>Faced with these contradictions, critical questions arise: <strong>Is AI really the solution to all our modern problems—or are we simply creating new ones?</strong> What <strong>ecological</strong> and <strong>social side effects</strong> accompany the AI boom? And who decides <em>how</em> an AI should solve a problem? One thing is certain: An AI always acts according to the goals and priorities we set for it.</p>

<p>Consider this thought experiment: What if an AI were tasked with achieving <em>climate goals at all costs</em>? In extreme cases, it might weigh human suffering against emission reductions. Whether it prioritizes <em>individual well-being</em> or the <em>collective good</em> depends on the values it has been trained with. The question of <strong>how</strong> AI “thinks” is thus closely tied to societal values, ethical boundaries, and—most importantly—<strong>who defines them</strong>.</p>

<p>A real-world example from the U.S. highlights how societal biases can creep into AI systems: Facial recognition software used by U.S. police forces misidentified several innocent Black men as suspects. The problem wasn’t just technical—it stemmed from biased training data and decisions that reproduced systemic inequalities. Algorithms were significantly less accurate at identifying non-white faces, especially Black individuals. Studies showed that the error rate for Black women reached up to <strong>35%</strong>, compared to under <strong>1%</strong> for white men (<a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/gender-shades/overview/">MIT Media Lab, 2018</a>).</p>

<p>Different priorities and blind spots can lead to radically different “solutions”—from technological efficiency to social redistribution. What’s considered “right” ultimately depends on the worldview and objectives behind a system. AI is therefore not a neutral all-rounder but a <strong>tool</strong> shaped by human assumptions. It cannot think—it merely detects and reproduces patterns from the data it was trained on. As such, it cannot develop its own moral framework or make ethical decisions. These too must be programmed by us. Ethical trade-offs—so essential in many societal debates—are beyond AI’s reach unless explicitly defined by humans.</p>

<p>So who really benefits from this AI revolution—and who is left behind? Right now, it’s primarily large tech companies that control the necessary data and computing power, concentrating influence in the hands of a few. Experts warn that AI development risks becoming monopolized, potentially stifling innovation and increasing global dependency (<a href="https://yalelawandpolicy.org/antimonopoly-approach-governing-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Yale Law &amp; Policy Review, 2024</a>). At the same time, millions of jobs are at risk. A study by Goldman Sachs estimates that up to <strong>300 million jobs</strong> worldwide could be automated or altered by generative AI (<a href="https://www.industryintel.com/news/goldman-sachs-ai-could-replace-up-to-300-million-full-time-jobs-globally-with-administrative-and-legal-sectors-at-highest-risk-generative-ai-marks-leap-in-automation-and-could-increase-global-annual-value-of-goods-or-services-output-by-7--171642439200?utm_source">industry intelligence inc., 2025</a>). Administrative, legal, and routine-heavy office work is especially vulnerable. New professions are emerging—like <em>prompt engineering</em>—but the <strong>social transformations</strong> will be far-reaching. However, this shift is occurring more slowly than anticipated a decade ago (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/publications/ai-outlook/">OECD, 2023</a>), making long-term predictions difficult, both technologically and socially.</p>

<p>And the core issue remains: <strong>Can AI truly innovate—or is it just remixing what already exists?</strong> Many experts argue that today’s models, such as GPT-4, are highly capable pattern recognition machines (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00631">vgl. Marcus &amp; Davis, “Rebooting AI”, 2019</a>). They generate outputs by recombining known information—but without any actual understanding. What’s missing is context, a sense of purpose, or even curiosity.</p>

<p><strong>Genuine innovation</strong>—like the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics—requires paradigm shifts, interdisciplinary thinking, and the courage to challenge established ideas. These abilities are deeply rooted in human cognition and remain impossible to replicate algorithmically. At best, AI can serve as a catalyst or assistive tool—generating hypotheses or speeding up workflows—but not as a true source of disruptive breakthroughs. It remains dependent on human-defined goals, data, and evaluation metrics.</p>

<h2 id="ai-only-works-as-a-tool">AI Only Works as a Tool</h2>

<p>How can AI be expected to solve humanity’s grand challenges if it can’t truly innovate? In many ways, AI risks exacerbating the very inequalities it claims to fix. The climate crisis, for example, is not just an ecological emergency but also a social one. Studies show that wealthier populations contribute far more to global emissions, while poorer communities bear the brunt—facing heatwaves, food insecurity, or lack of adaptive infrastructure (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/07/two-thirds-of-global-heating-caused-by-richest-study-suggests?utm_source=chatgpt.com">The Guardian, 2025</a>). If AI is primarily deployed for economic optimization and industrial efficiency, these imbalances risk being reinforced. New challenges may emerge—without solving the old ones.</p>

<p>If we accept that AI is not <em>the</em> solution, we must ask: <strong>How can it be part of one?</strong> The key lies in understanding AI as a <strong>tool</strong>. And like any tool, it depends on <strong>how and for what</strong> it is used. Responsible governance is essential—grounded in ethical reflection, fair policies, and the political will to shape AI for the common good.</p>

<p>In practical terms, developers, companies, and institutions have a responsibility to use AI consciously—for instance, to detect climate risks early, promote equitable resource use, or democratize access to knowledge. Even on the technical level, there are levers for change: Developers who engage with the principles of <em>green coding</em> can already contribute to sustainability in small but meaningful ways. AI itself can be used deliberately to make one’s code more sustainable—how exactly that works will be the focus of the <strong>next article in this series</strong> (<a href="https://mehrwert.tech/en/KI-II">Green Coding with AI – ChatGPT as a Tool for Sustainable Programming</a>). For a general introduction to the topic, see our article <a href="https://mehrwert.tech/en/green-coding">„Green coding - sustainability in software development“</a>, and for practical approaches, refer to <a href="https://mehrwert.tech/en/green-coding-patterns">„Green Coding Patterns - Practical Tips for Energy-Efficient Software“</a>. This way, AI becomes not an end in itself but a building block of a more sustainable digital future. It’s not the technology itself that makes the difference—but our decisions about how we use it.</p>

<p>In the end, AI is not a magic fix. It’s a component of a more sustainable digital future. What makes the difference is not the technology itself—but <strong>our choices in how we use it.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name>Alina</name></author><category term="posts" /><category term="#green-coding," /><category term="#nachhaltigkeit," /><category term="#ki" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“AI will reach singularity by 2030.” This bold claim by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman illustrates the immense hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), severe impacts can only be mitigated through <strong>immediate emission reductions</strong>. IT plays a dual role: on the one hand, digitalization can help reduce emissions in other sectors (<em>green by IT</em>). On the other hand, the industry itself must become more sustainable (<em>green in IT</em>).</p>

<p>Software is at the center of this transformation—because <strong>sustainable software is efficient software</strong>. Every inefficient line of code creates not only technical but also <strong>ecological debt</strong>. Like technical debt, it can impair <strong>long-term maintainability and efficiency</strong>—but with the added impact on <strong>real resources like electricity and CO₂</strong>. The good news: no radical changes are needed—what matters most is a <strong>sharpened awareness</strong> and a few <strong>targeted adjustments</strong>. This article presents practical <strong>Green Coding Patterns</strong> that are easy to integrate into everyday development.</p>

<h2 id="small-levers-big-impact">Small Levers, Big Impact</h2>

<p>Sustainable development doesn’t have to start with a complete overhaul. Often, <strong>small everyday changes</strong>—a different format here, a more conscious decision there—can lead to <strong>measurable effects</strong>. These adjustments act like <strong>levers</strong>: small in effort but large in impact. Many small decisions can significantly <strong>reduce energy consumption across multiple levels</strong>.</p>

<p>Changing behaviors step by step leads to a <strong>new awareness</strong>. What feels like an extra effort today can soon become the <strong>new normal</strong>. The following examples highlight such <strong>small levers with big impact</strong>—immediately applicable and effective for both the environment and system performance.</p>

<h2 id="efficiency-through-reduced-computation">Efficiency Through Reduced Computation</h2>

<p>One of the first levers lies in the <strong>code itself</strong>: the less computational power an application requires, the less energy it consumes. <strong>Avoiding unnecessary calculations</strong> is a key lever—just as a fuel-efficient car uses less gas, efficient code uses less electricity. It’s not about perfection, but about setting clear <strong>priorities for resource use</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid unnecessary processes</strong>: Does every click really need to trigger a new query? Does the entire DOM need to re-render? Smart event handling and caching can prevent excess computation.</li>
  <li><strong>Prefer simple data types</strong>: Integer operations often use less energy than floating-point ones. Small changes in data handling can make a big difference.</li>
  <li><strong>Use precompiled resources</strong>: Bundle and optimize scripts and assets before delivery to reduce computation on end devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transferring-data-efficiently">Transferring Data Efficiently</h2>

<p><strong>Data traffic also consumes energy</strong>—on end devices, in networks, and in data centers. The rule: the less, the better.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Transfer only necessary data</strong>: Keep API responses and database queries focused on essentials.</li>
  <li><strong>Compress files</strong>: Text and image files can often be reduced significantly in size without losing quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Use caching effectively</strong>: Repeated data retrievals can be avoided by storing static content locally or on the server.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="energy-efficient-interfaces-and-ux">Energy-Efficient Interfaces and UX</h2>

<p>The <strong>design of an application</strong> directly influences its energy demand. <strong>User-friendliness and resource efficiency</strong> are not mutually exclusive—they go hand in hand.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use images efficiently</strong>: Lean formats like WebP and properly scaled media reduce file size and energy consumption.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce animations</strong>: Visual effects increase GPU usage, especially on mobile devices. Less is more.</li>
  <li><strong>Offer dark mode</strong>: On OLED screens, a dark interface saves energy and improves accessibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimize loading times</strong>: Faster loading not only saves energy but also improves user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-resources-more-wisely">Using Resources More Wisely</h2>

<p>The <strong>infrastructure</strong> behind an application also holds potential for optimization. The goal is to <strong>scale resources to actual needs</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scale based on demand</strong>: Systems should automatically adapt to load and scale down during off-peak times.</li>
  <li><strong>Shut down unnecessary environments</strong>: Development and test environments don’t need to run 24/7.</li>
  <li><strong>Use serverless and containers</strong>: These technologies help use hardware more efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="carbon-aware-coding">Carbon-Aware Coding</h2>

<p>Not all electricity is equally green. CO₂ emissions per kilowatt-hour vary depending on the time of day and grid load—depending on whether <strong>renewable sources like wind and solar</strong> are feeding the grid or whether <strong>fossil fuels</strong> dominate. This is called <strong>carbon intensity</strong>, describing how much carbon dioxide is emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity. <strong>Carbon-aware coding</strong> takes these variations into account.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Schedule intelligently</strong>: Batch jobs or analyses can be timed to run during periods of <strong>low grid load or lower CO₂ intensity</strong>—for instance, when renewables are abundant. Tools like the Carbon Aware SDK or apps like StromGedacht help identify particularly green times in the grid mix.</li>
  <li><strong>Adapt to device states</strong>: Applications should detect whether a device is in energy-saving mode and adjust their behavior accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="measuring-and-improving">Measuring and Improving</h2>

<p><strong>Sustainability needs metrics</strong>. Only what is measured can be improved. A <strong>realistic overview</strong> of energy usage is the foundation for meaningful change.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Measure energy consumption</strong>: There are various ways to track how much energy an application uses—through <strong>runtime profiling</strong> or <strong>indirect indicators</strong> like CPU load, runtime, or memory usage. While these proxies aren’t precise, they offer helpful insights. More detailed analysis can be done with specialized tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Use benchmarks</strong>: Standardized metrics like the <strong>Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)</strong> make progress measurable. A practical example is available in the <a href="https://mehrwert.tech/en/powermetrics">previous article on energy analysis with Powermetrics</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="low-hanging-fruits-saving-energy-on-devices">Low Hanging Fruits: Saving Energy on Devices</h2>

<p>Not all optimization happens in code or infrastructure—<strong>devices themselves</strong> offer opportunities for simple yet effective actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Activate dark mode</strong>: Especially on OLED screens, this can significantly reduce power usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce screen brightness</strong>: One of the simplest ways to save energy.</li>
  <li><strong>Shut down devices after hours</strong>: Turning off monitors, laptops, and peripherals avoids unnecessary standby power.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable energy-saving modes</strong>: Many operating systems and IDEs offer these features—they’re often just unused.</li>
  <li><strong>Close unused tabs and applications</strong>: Less load on the CPU means less energy consumed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>These small, easy-to-implement actions</strong> complement structural improvements and make <strong>Green Coding</strong> a <strong>holistic approach</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>One major advantage:</strong> Many of these actions can be implemented <strong>individually</strong>, <strong>without team consensus or lengthy discussions</strong>. Anyone adjusting local power settings or activating energy-saving features can <strong>have an immediate impact</strong>. A portion of the <strong>responsibility</strong>—and <strong>freedom to act</strong>—lies in one’s own hands.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-small-steps-big-difference">Conclusion: Small Steps, Big Difference</h2>

<p><strong>Green Coding doesn’t have to be complex.</strong> Many practices are simple to implement and deliver real impact. <strong>Efficient code</strong>, <strong>reduced data transfer</strong>, and <strong>thoughtful interfaces</strong> help lower energy consumption while making software more <strong>performant and reliable</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Developers have the power</strong> to make software more sustainable—one line at a time.</p>

<p>Video conferencing has become an integral part of our everyday lives. But how climate-friendly are tools like Zoom, Teams, and FaceTime really? In a self-experiment, all three tools were tested under identical conditions – with some surprising results.</p>

<p>This wasn’t just about the tools themselves, but also about a central question: Can the energy consumption of digital applications be measured and compared with simple methods? The answer is: <strong>Yes.</strong> Using the built-in <strong>powermetrics</strong> tool available on every Mac and some scripting in <strong>Python</strong>, a realistic test setup was created. It shows that even without expensive hardware or specialized software, meaningful energy comparisons are possible. The experiment proves that solid insights into energy efficiency can be achieved in a <strong>low-threshold and reproducible</strong> way – an important aspect for IT professionals who take sustainability seriously in their digital infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="setup-and-objective">Setup and Objective</h2>

<p>The self-experiment was conducted in <strong>June/July 2023</strong> on a <strong>MacBookPro17,1 running macOS Ventura Version 13.3</strong>. Only the energy consumption on the device itself was considered – meaning the energy demand of each application on the MacBook, excluding network usage or external infrastructure. The three widely used video conferencing tools <strong>Zoom</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong>, and <strong>FaceTime</strong> were tested. The goal was to examine how incoming and outgoing video and screen sharing impact energy consumption – and whether recommendations for more sustainable usage can be derived.</p>

<p>At the same time, the experiment aimed to demonstrate that tools like <strong>powermetrics</strong>, a <strong>Python script</strong>, and a well-designed test setup can already be used to make qualitative statements about energy efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>Each tool was tested in various scenarios: <strong>incoming video on/off, outgoing video on/off, and screen sharing on/off</strong>. The so-called <strong>Energy Impact</strong> was recorded – a model value generated by powermetrics and saved as a text file. A <strong>restart</strong> was performed before each measurement series to terminate unnecessary processes. Additionally, a <strong>baseline</strong> was established by modeling the Energy Impact after a restart with no programs open.</p>

<p>Measurements were conducted in <strong>10-minute blocks</strong>. Each scenario was repeated <strong>three times</strong>, and the <strong>average Energy Impact</strong> was calculated.</p>

<p>The analysis script was written in <strong>Python</strong>: relevant data was extracted using <strong>regex</strong>, transferred to a <strong>Pandas DataFrame</strong>, and <strong>visualized</strong>.</p>

<p>The test setup was intentionally kept <strong>realistic</strong>: video calls were conducted between two laptops. An external display showed a standardized test video with audio, which was recorded by the MacBook’s camera. This ensured that all scenarios were <strong>consistent and reproducible</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="results-overview">Results Overview</h2>

<p>The two charts below clearly show the average Energy Impact of the tested video conferencing tools in two groups of scenarios: with and without screen sharing. This makes it easy to visually compare the energy profiles of the applications.</p>

<p>The results reveal clear differences between the tools – especially with screen sharing and active video. <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> performed <strong>worse in almost all scenarios</strong> compared to Zoom and FaceTime. Only in the <strong>minimal mode without video or screen sharing</strong> were the results across all tools relatively similar.</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/mit-screen-sharing-en.png" alt="Energy Impact with screen sharing" /></p>

<p>These data clearly show: <strong>The choice of tool and video conference configuration has a direct impact on energy consumption.</strong> Especially for regular meetings, it’s worth being mindful about camera and screen sharing behavior – particularly when using Teams.</p>

<p>A particularly revealing comparison is between the “everything off” and “everything on” scenarios. While FaceTime and Zoom showed almost identical values with only incoming or outgoing video compared to the “everything off” scenario, Microsoft Teams showed a dramatic difference: <strong>Energy Impact increased by a factor of 80</strong> when all features – incoming and outgoing video and screen sharing – were enabled. In comparison: FaceTime’s consumption only increased by about <strong>a factor of five</strong>, Zoom by <strong>a factor of three</strong>. This not only highlights the technical efficiency of each platform, but also the immense potential for optimization through conscious use.</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/ohne-screen-sharing-en.png" alt="Energy Impact without screen sharing" /></p>

<p>In the scenario with all features enabled (<strong>“Video in/out + screen sharing on”</strong>), the <strong>Energy Impact for Teams was about three times higher</strong> than in minimal mode with everything disabled – a significant difference that adds up over time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-understanding-energy-use--a-foundation-for-sustainable-software">Conclusion: Understanding Energy Use – A Foundation for Sustainable Software</h2>

<p>The self-experiment shows <strong>just how wide the differences in energy consumption</strong> between video conferencing tools can be. Even with <strong>basic built-in tools</strong>, <strong>meaningful results</strong> can be achieved. This approach makes it possible to <strong>gradually engage with the complex topic of software energy efficiency</strong> – without immediately needing specialized measurement equipment or large resources.</p>

<p>The insights gained provide a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for evaluating software in terms of energy efficiency – and build a bridge to the <strong>Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) standard</strong>, which focuses on the <strong>transparent measurement and optimization of CO₂ emissions from software</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>With the right tool and more conscious usage, even everyday applications can be used more sustainably.</strong></p>

As we’ve already explored in our <a href="https://mehrwert.tech/software-obsoleszenz">previous article</a>, software decisions can significantly affect hardware longevity.</p>

<p>In this post, we focus on an approach that makes the <strong>energy consumption of software itself</strong> and its related CO₂ emissions visible. The <strong>Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)</strong> standard, developed by the Green Software Foundation, helps developers and companies model the emissions of their applications and supports them in making more conscious decisions.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-software-carbon-intensity-sci">What is Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)?</h2>

<p>SCI brings transparency to the environmental impact of software and provides a simple formula and clear methodology to estimate CO₂ emissions. The goal is to create an objective and repeatable foundation for making software more <strong>ecologically</strong> sustainable.</p>

<h2 id="how-sci-works">How SCI Works</h2>

<p>SCI models the CO₂ emissions caused both during operation and in the creation of software. This includes <em>energy consumption</em>, <em>hardware efficiency</em>, and the <em>energy mix</em>. It gives developers the transparency they need to pinpoint the areas with the greatest potential for effective carbon reduction.</p>

<p>The core formula of SCI is:</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/SCI.png" alt="Formula of Software Carbon Intensity" />
<small> <a href="https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/measurement/">Green Software Foundation</a></small></p>

<p>In this formula, <em>E</em> represents the energy consumed by the software in kWh, <em>I</em> the amount of CO₂ per kWh consumed, and <em>M</em> the embodied carbon. (To learn more about what embodied carbon means and how it’s measured, check out our series on <a href="https://mehrwert.tech/embodied-carbon-1">Embodied Carbon</a>). The factor <em>R</em> normalizes these emissions per use, user, system runtime, or access – depending on the context and availability of data. In Germany, the average value for <em>I</em> in 2023 was 380 g CO₂/kWh (Umweltbundesamt, 2023). Further values and country-specific data can be found at <a href="https://app.electricitymaps.com/">electricityMaps</a> or the <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-browser?country=WORLD\&amp;fuel=Energy%20consumption\&amp;indicator=Electricity%20generation%20by%20source">IEA</a>.</p>

<p>A practical example for measuring energy consumption is modeling via CPU and RAM usage. Alternatively, energy can be estimated using network load, number and type of processes, or standardized benchmark tests. The chosen methods must always be well-documented and reproducible to ensure transparency. A physical power meter isn’t strictly necessary – script-based tools like Apple’s “powermetrics” can reliably estimate actual hardware utilization.</p>

<h2 id="an-internationally-recognized-iso-standard">An Internationally Recognized ISO Standard</h2>

<p>Since 2024, SCI has been officially recognized as an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 21031:2024). It defines clear criteria and methods for transparently measuring and reporting the carbon footprint of software. As a result, it has gained international relevance and acceptance, making it easier to implement across the industry. Companies benefit from a globally accepted framework that enables consistent and comparable sustainability assessments.</p>

<h2 id="measuring-is-winning">Measuring is Winning</h2>

<p>SCI allows companies to compare the environmental efficiency of different software solutions and make informed, sustainable choices. Developers integrate the methodology directly into their workflows, leading to more resource-efficient products in the long term (Green Software Foundation Projects, 2024). Solid data is essential here – because you can only improve what you can measure. SCI provides this data, creating the foundation for real transparency and actionable sustainability in software development.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-and-criticism">Challenges and Criticism</h2>

<p>Implementing a new standard comes with its challenges. Accurate measurements rely on high-quality data, which can be time-consuming to collect. To make SCI truly effective, it needs to be put into practice and backed by real-world examples. Even rough estimates are enough to trigger improvements and identify the most impactful areas for reducing emissions.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Software Carbon Intensity standard sets a new benchmark for sustainable software development. With clear, measurable outcomes, it empowers organizations and developers to take meaningful action on emissions. Now it’s up to the industry to adopt the standard and drive real change for a more sustainable digital future.

Many hardware components are discarded today even though they are still technically functional. The reason? Modern software places ever <strong>higher demands on processors, memory, and other resources</strong>. Industry analyses show that increasing software requirements drive hardware replacements more than pure technological innovation. This dynamic has significant implications for companies aiming to manage their IT infrastructure <strong>efficiently, cost-effectively, and sustainably</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="software-as-the-key-to-hardware-longevity">Software as the Key to Hardware Longevity</h2>

<p>Software largely determines <strong>how long hardware remains usable</strong>. Functional hardware is often <strong>replaced prematurely</strong> because rising software demands make it obsolete—a phenomenon known as <strong>software obsolescence</strong>. As the technological gap between hardware generations narrows, software—not hardware innovation—has become the primary driver of increasing electronic waste. Lack of software support or compatibility with newer programs renders older devices practically useless, even when the hardware is still functional. This form of software-driven aging leads to hardware being discarded before reaching its full technical lifespan. Moreover, it makes <strong>refurbishment options less attractive or even impossible</strong>, as older devices can no longer be effectively reused due to compatibility issues with modern software. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">[Wikipedia]</a></p>

<h2 id="consequences-and-challenges">Consequences and Challenges</h2>

<p><strong>Software obsolescence</strong> forces companies to <strong>replace hardware more frequently</strong>, increasing investment costs and contradicting sustainability goals. According to a study by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), extending the lifespan of computers by just one year could reduce the environmental impact of these devices by approximately 25%. <a href="https://eeb.org/revealed-the-climate-cost-of-disposable-smartphones/">[EEB, 2019]</a> Manufacturers must design software, products, and services to ensure <strong>long-term support and compatibility</strong>, allowing hardware to remain in use for longer periods.</p>

<h2 id="strategies-for-extending-hardware-lifespan">Strategies for Extending Hardware Lifespan</h2>

<p>Companies can extend the lifespan of their hardware through conscious decisions in software development and selection. It is essential to prioritize software products whose vendors guarantee <strong>long-term support (LTS) versions</strong>. This reduces the need for frequent hardware replacements while ensuring prolonged usability. Products that utilize <strong>open interfaces and standard formats</strong> enable better integration with older systems and offer long-term flexibility for software updates and modifications. To help customers make informed decisions, vendors must provide <strong>transparent communication</strong> regarding product support duration, hardware requirements, and long-term compatibility.</p>

<p>A recent example is the Google Pixel 9, which has been announced with guaranteed security updates until at least October 2033. Additionally, Google has clearly communicated the hardware specifications necessary for long-term usage. <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Pixel-9a-Googles-Antwort-auf-das-Apple-iPhone-16e-10321170.html">[Heise, 2025]</a> This transparency allows businesses to plan their IT infrastructure more reliably.</p>

<p>Furthermore, software updates should not artificially degrade older hardware performance through intentional slowdowns or exclusion from new versions. <strong>Transparent and fair update strategies</strong> promote longer hardware lifecycles. The use of <strong>open-source software</strong> also extends hardware lifespan, as the community continuously develops and adapts solutions for older devices. Companies should also plan hardware upgrades <strong>based on actual needs</strong>, utilizing modern monitoring tools to assess performance accurately and prevent unnecessary investments.</p>

<h3 id="development-of-security-updates-for-smartphones">Development of Security Updates for Smartphones</h3>

<p><img class="img-fluid w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/Security Update Duration of Apple iPhones and Google Pixel Smartphones.png" alt="Duration of Security Updates for iPhones and Google Pixel Smartphones" />
<small> <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softwareaktualisierung#Google">Wikipedia Google</a>, <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">Wikipedia iPhone</a></small></p>

<p>The chart illustrates the increasing length of guaranteed security updates for iPhone and Google Pixel models over recent years. This trend is highly positive, as extended update periods improve device usability and security. Businesses and users must now adapt to these improved and more sustainable usage cycles and adjust their IT strategies accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="how-software-developers-can-promote-hardware-longevity">How Software Developers Can Promote Hardware Longevity</h2>

<p>Software developers play a crucial role in extending hardware lifespan. <strong>Resource-efficient programming</strong> helps by optimizing algorithms, minimizing background processes, and reducing memory usage. Particularly memory-intensive tasks or unnecessary graphical effects should be optional and adjustable to avoid excessive strain on older hardware. Developers should also ensure <strong>long-term compatibility</strong> by regularly testing software on older hardware generations and operating systems.</p>

<p>Supporting <strong>backward compatibility</strong> is essential, ensuring that updates do not exclude older devices. Applications should be designed in a modular and scalable way so that resource-intensive features are only activated if the hardware can handle them. This allows users with older devices to continue enjoying a good user experience without being forced to upgrade. Each new feature should be critically evaluated for its actual value, as unnecessary additions can significantly burden hardware.</p>

<p>Additionally, developers should adopt <strong>sustainable update strategies</strong>, separating security updates from feature enhancements. This allows users to keep older devices secure without being forced to install resource-heavy new functionalities. Whenever possible, developers should use <strong>open standards and open-source components</strong> to ensure long-term software maintenance by the community.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-extending-hardware-lifespan">Benefits of Extending Hardware Lifespan</h2>

<p>Extending hardware lifespan offers clear advantages for businesses. It leads to <strong>significant cost savings</strong>, as fewer hardware purchases ease IT budgets while reducing maintenance, setup, and disposal costs. Sustainable IT practices contribute to less electronic waste, lower resource consumption, and an improved carbon footprint, strengthening a company’s environmental reputation. Additionally, <strong>competitive advantages</strong> arise as sustainable IT strategies enhance corporate image and increase customer loyalty, especially as more consumers and partners prioritize ecological responsibility.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By managing software requirements wisely and implementing strategic software development approaches, businesses can significantly extend hardware lifespan. This leads to financial benefits while making a meaningful contribution to environmental sustainability. Given the substantial environmental impact of hardware production—also known as <strong>embodied carbon</strong> (more on this in our article series on <a href="https://mehrwert.tech/en/embodied-carbon-1"><strong>Embodied Carbon</strong></a> )—extending hardware lifespan is essential.</p>

<p>Software developers and companies can further contribute through *<a href="https://mehrwert.tech/en/trainings/gsp.html"><strong>Green Coding</strong></a>, which promotes sustainable software practices.

While many sustainability efforts concentrate on the <strong>operational phase</strong>, significant emissions arise <strong>already during the construction phase</strong> and through hardware production. You can find the second part of the series on embodied carbon <a href="https://mehrwert.tech/embodied-carbon-2">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="construction-phase-a-frequently-underestimated-emission-factor"><strong>Construction Phase: A Frequently Underestimated Emission Factor</strong></h2>

<p>The <strong>construction of a data center</strong> is one of the most emission-intensive phases of its lifecycle. Materials such as <strong>steel, concrete, and aluminum</strong> cause high <strong>CO₂ emissions during production and transportation</strong>. The main environmental impacts stem from:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Concrete Production:</strong> Concrete is responsible for <strong>about 8% of global CO₂ emissions</strong>, primarily due to the <strong>energy-intensive cement production process</strong>. <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1675/2019/">[Andrew, R. M., 2019]</a> The construction of a medium-sized data center can require several thousand tons of concrete, depending on the size and construction method. Since the production of one ton of cement generates an average of 0.6 to 0.9 tons of CO₂, this results in CO₂ emissions of several thousand tons.</li>
  <li><strong>Steel Production:</strong> Producing <strong>one ton of steel emits roughly 1.5 tons of CO₂</strong>. <a href="https://dechema.de/Themen/Studien%2Bund%2BPositionspapiere/2024%2B03%2BH2%2BKompass/_/H2K_IND_Stahl.pdf">[acatech, 2024]</a> Data centers use <strong>large quantities of steel</strong> for both the building structure and <strong>server racks</strong>. For example, there are approximately <strong>266,000 server racks</strong> in German data centers. <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/461/publikationen/4037.pdf">[Umweltbundesamt, 2010]</a> The <strong>CO₂ emissions per ton of steel</strong> vary considerably depending on the <strong>production method</strong>. While traditional methods generate high emissions, new technologies such as the <strong>use of green hydrogen</strong> could significantly improve the balance. These approaches, however, are still in the <strong>development phase</strong> and require <strong>high energy input</strong>. <a href="https://dwv-info.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/20210616-EP-Gruener-Stahl-min-1.pdf">[DWV, 2021]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Aluminum Processing:</strong> <strong>Aluminum has a high energy density</strong> during production but is widely used in data centers due to its <strong>light weight</strong> and <strong>corrosion resistance</strong>. <strong>Producing one ton of primary aluminum emits on average 11.5 tons of CO₂.</strong> The exact figure may vary depending on the <strong>production method</strong> and <strong>energy source</strong>. Aluminum production is particularly energy-intensive, as the <strong>extraction from bauxite</strong> requires vast amounts of electricity. <a href="https://international-aluminium.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CF-Good-Guidance-v1-2018.pdf">[International Aluminium Institute, 2018]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Energy Consumption During Construction:</strong> The <strong>construction phase</strong> demands <strong>large quantities of electrical energy</strong> for machinery, transportation, and the assembly of IT infrastructure. Since most <strong>construction equipment runs on fossil fuels</strong>, significant <strong>CO₂ emissions</strong> are generated – especially from <strong>diesel-powered excavators, cranes, and concrete mixers</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="operational-phase-the-main-contributor-to-co-emissions"><strong>Operational Phase: The Main Contributor to CO₂ Emissions</strong></h2>

<p>After completion, the <strong>operation of a data center</strong> continuously generates emissions, primarily due to the <strong>power consumption for IT hardware, cooling, and supporting infrastructure</strong>. The key factors include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Server Power Consumption:</strong> <strong>Data centers worldwide consumed around 360 TWh of electricity in 2022</strong>, which is about <strong>1.7% of the global energy demand</strong>. <a href="https://www.gewinn.com/artikel/rechenzentren-sind-wachstumstreiber-der-stromnachfrage">[Gewinn, 2024]</a>, <a href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/239764/umfrage/weltweiter-stromverbrauch/">[Statista, 2024]</a> The actual <strong>emissions depend heavily on the energy mix</strong> – while <strong>renewable energy sources can minimize the CO₂ footprint</strong>, fossil fuels lead to significant emissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Cooling can account for up to <strong>40% of the total energy consumption</strong>. <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_IT">[Wikipedia]</a> <strong>Efficient cooling methods</strong>, such as <strong>liquid cooling</strong> or <strong>utilizing outside air</strong>, can considerably reduce emissions.</li>
  <li><strong>Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE):</strong> <strong>Modern data centers achieve PUE values of 1.2 or lower</strong>, whereas <strong>older facilities may exceed values of 2</strong>, leading to massive energy losses. <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/de/meinung/Energieeffizienz-von-Rechenzentren-aus-alt-mach-nachhaltig">[Computer Weekly, 2023]</a> <strong>The PUE value describes the ratio between the total energy consumption of a data center and the energy actually used for IT infrastructure</strong> – the lower the value, the <strong>more efficiently the energy is used</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Backup Systems:</strong> <strong>Diesel generators as backup power units generate significant CO₂ emissions</strong> and air pollution, particularly in <strong>older facilities</strong>. <a href="https://www.bund-hessen.de/pm/news/bund-klagt-gegen-zu-hohe-emissionen-aus-notstromdieselmotoren-von-rechenzentren/">[Umweltbundesamt, 2022]</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="decommissioning-and-recycling-what-happens-after-1525-years"><strong>Decommissioning and Recycling: What Happens After 15–25 Years?</strong></h2>

<p>After approximately <strong>15–25 years</strong>, a <strong>data center is either modernized or decommissioned</strong>. This step also causes <strong>environmental impacts</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Disposal of Building Materials:</strong> Without a <strong>sustainable deconstruction concept</strong>, large amounts of <strong>concrete, steel, and other building materials end up in landfills</strong> rather than being recycled.</li>
  <li><strong>Electronic Waste:</strong> <strong>Over 60 million tons of electronic waste are generated worldwide each year</strong>, of which <strong>only a fraction is recycled</strong>. <a href="https://ewastemonitor.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GEM_2024_EN_11_NOV-web.pdf">[unitar, 2024]</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="environmental-impact-of-data-centers-over-their-entire-lifecycle"><strong>Environmental Impact of Data Centers Over Their Entire Lifecycle</strong></h2>

<p>The <strong>BUND</strong> conducted a study in <strong>2018</strong> to assess the <strong>resource consumption</strong> and <strong>CO₂ emissions</strong> of various data centers over their <strong>entire lifecycle</strong>. <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/1410/publikationen/2018-02-23_texte_19-2018_ressourceneffizienz-rechenzentren.pdf">[Bundesumweltamt, 2018]</a> The environmental impacts were divided into <strong>four phases</strong>: <strong>production</strong> (green), distribution, usage, and disposal.**</p>

<p>The model data centers were:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DC1:</strong> A <strong>municipal data center</strong> with an <strong>IT rated capacity of 750 kW</strong>. It is used for <strong>managed services and colocation</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>DC2:</strong> A <strong>web hosting data center</strong> with an <strong>IT rated capacity of 83 kW</strong>. It primarily provides <strong>hosting services</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>DC3:</strong> An <strong>IT consulting data center</strong> with an <strong>IT rated capacity of 192 kW</strong>. It mainly serves <strong>internal corporate services</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The environmental impacts of the data centers were analyzed based on various <strong>indicators</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ADP (Abiotic Depletion Potential):</strong> This measures the impact on the availability of <strong>non-renewable resources</strong> such as <strong>metals and fossil fuels</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>KEA (Cumulative Energy Demand):</strong> This indicator describes the <strong>total amount of energy</strong> required over the <strong>lifecycle</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>GHG (Greenhouse Gas Potential):</strong> This indicator measures the <strong>CO₂ emissions</strong> over the entire <strong>lifecycle</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Water Consumption:</strong> This indicator assesses the <strong>total water usage</strong> throughout the <strong>lifecycle</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="img-fluid w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/Relative_Umweltauswirkungen_Rechenzentrum.png" alt="Relative distribution of the environmental impacts of data centers by lifecycle phase" />
<small> <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/1410/publikationen/2018-02-23_texte_19-2018_ressourceneffizienz-rechenzentren.pdf">Bundesumweltamt, 2018</a></small></p>

<p>The analysis clearly shows that across all indicators, <strong>the operational phase is the largest contributor to environmental impact</strong>, particularly in terms of <strong>energy consumption and CO₂ emissions</strong>. However, the <strong>production of hardware</strong> also contributes <strong>significantly</strong> to the environmental impacts, especially regarding the <strong>abiotic depletion potential</strong>. In contrast, the <strong>disposal phase</strong> has a <strong>comparatively low share</strong> of the overall impacts. Although this study was published back in 2018, its findings remain highly relevant, as the fundamental sources of emissions and environmental impacts of data centers have hardly changed since then.</p>

<h2 id="measures-towards-greener-data-centers"><strong>Measures Towards Greener Data Centers</strong></h2>

<p>To minimize the <strong>environmental impact</strong> of a data center over its <strong>entire lifecycle</strong>, various approaches are necessary:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sustainable Construction:</strong> Using <strong>CO₂-reduced concrete, recycled steel</strong> and <strong>sustainable materials</strong> can lower emissions during the construction phase.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy-Efficient Hardware:</strong> <strong>Modern processors and memory technologies</strong> with <strong>lower power consumption</strong> reduce the <strong>CO₂ output</strong> during operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Green Energy Sources:</strong> Using <strong>renewable energies</strong> such as <strong>wind and solar power</strong> can make a data center’s electricity consumption nearly <strong>climate-neutral</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Waste Heat Recovery:</strong> Through <strong>intelligent heat recovery systems</strong>, data centers can channel their waste heat to <strong>local residential or industrial areas</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Circular Economy:</strong> The <strong>reuse</strong> and <strong>recycling</strong> of <strong>servers, building materials</strong> and other <strong>components</strong> can extend their <strong>lifespan</strong> and <strong>reduce waste</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Data centers are the backbone of the digital world, yet they generate significant CO₂ emissions over their entire lifecycle.</strong> While the <strong>ongoing electricity consumption</strong> often takes center stage, the <strong>construction phase</strong> as well as the <strong>disposal of building materials and hardware</strong> must not be neglected.</p>

<p>Through <strong>sustainable construction practices, energy-efficient hardware, renewable energy, waste heat recovery, and a circular economy approach</strong>, companies can significantly reduce their <strong>ecological footprint</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>It is time to design the IT infrastructure of the future so that it is not only high-performing but also sustainable.</strong></p>

<p><img class="img-fluid w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/smartphone_resources.jpg" alt="Raw materials that make up a smartphone" />
<small>Quelle: <a href="https://www.regenwald-schuetzen.org/regenwald-wissen/faszination-regenwald/haeufige-fragen/welche-rohstoffe-gibt-es">OroVerde - Die Tropenwaldstiftung</a></small></p>

<p>IT devices consist of a variety of materials such as silicon, copper, gold and rare earths. However, their extraction has serious consequences for people and the environment:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Habitat Destruction:</b> The extraction of gold, lithium, and cobalt leads to deforestation of rainforests, soil contamination, and loss of natural habitats. Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has already destroyed over <b>500,000 hectares of rainforest</b> (Source: Global Forest Watch, 2023).</li>
<li><b>Soil contamination:</b> Many mining processes release toxic chemicals that can contaminate the soil. Particularly problematic is gold extraction using cyanide leaching, where toxic residues are often disposed of improperly, causing extensive soil contamination (<a href="https://earthworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Earthworks-Annual-Report-2023.pdf">[Source: Earthworks, 2023]</a>). Another critical issue is the release of toxic heavy metals from ore mining and refining processes, which can pollute the soil in the long term (<a href="https://earthworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Earthworks-Annual-Report-2023.pdf">[Source: Earthworks, 2023]</a>).</li>
<li><b>Water Consumption and Pollution:</b> Lithium extraction in the Atacama Desert consumes up to <b>2 million liters of water per ton of lithium</b> <a href="https://www.fr.de/wirtschaft/konflikte-wasser-10968084.html">[Source: Friends of the Earth, 2022]</a>. This leads to the drying out of local ecosystems and endangers indigenous communities.</li>
<li><b>Social Issues:</b> Up to <b>40,000 children work in cobalt mines</b> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo under hazardous conditions <a href="https://www.amnesty.de/informieren/aktuell/demokratische-republik-kongo-grosskonzerne-tun-zu-wenig-gegen-kinderarbeit">[Source: Amnesty International, 2023]</a>. Additionally, profits from raw materials finance armed conflicts and destabilize entire regions.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), demand for these raw materials will more than double by <strong>2040</strong>, which will further exacerbate the negative consequences. <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/sharp-declines-in-critical-mineral-prices-mask-risks-of-future-supply-strains-as-energy-transitions-advance">Source: International Energy Agency, 2024</a></p>

<h2 id="energy-intensive-production-the-hidden-co-driver"><strong>Energy-intensive production: the hidden CO₂ driver</strong></h2>

<p>The extraction of raw materials is followed by an energy-intensive manufacturing process that causes enormous amounts of CO₂ emissions:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Semiconductor Manufacturing:</b> Producing microchips demands extremely high levels of purity, involving significant water and chemical consumption. Particularly problematic is production in Taiwan, which accounts for over <b>90% of global high-end chip manufacturing</b> <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/06/taiwans-dominance-of-the-chip-industry-makes-it-more-important">[Source: The Economist, 2023]</a>. Manufacturing a single 30 cm silicon wafer consumes <b>up to 8,000 liters of water</b>—an enormous strain for water-scarce regions like Taiwan. <a href="https://www.globalwaterintel.com">[Source: Global Water Intelligence (2009) Pure Water, Semiconductors and The Recession]</a></li>
<li><b>Circuit Board Manufacturing:</b> Etching copper traces produces toxic chemicals, which are often improperly disposed of. In China, where a large share of global circuit board production occurs, <b>thousands of tons of heavy metals and acids</b> contaminate the environment each year, polluting agricultural land and water sources. <a href="https://www.fraunhofer-zukunftsfabrik.de/?p=4256">[Source: Fraunhofer Institute, 2023]</a> Some manufacturers are now adopting alternative processes that reduce chemical use, but widespread implementation remains limited.</li>
<li><b>Battery production:</b> The production of lithium-ion batteries is among the most energy-intensive processes in the IT industry. Electrode manufacturing and cell assembly, in particular, require high temperatures and cleanroom conditions, leading to enormous energy consumption. Studies indicate that producing a lithium battery generates between <b>61</b> and <b>106 kg CO₂-equivalents per kWh battery capacity</b> <a href="https://ivl.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1549551/FULLTEXT01.pdf">[Source: IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute, 2019]</a>. In addition to the high electricity usage, substantial amounts of waste, including toxic solvents and electrolyte residues, are produced. Although manufacturers are exploring innovative alternatives like solid-state batteries and more efficient recycling methods, in the short term, battery production remains environmentally challenging.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transportation routes: an often overlooked factor</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid w-100" src="/assets/images/blog/smartphone_supply_chain.png" alt="Production cuts in smartphone manufacturing" />
<small>Quelle: <a href="https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/digital/smartphone-und-tablet/smartphone/langer-weg-eines-handys-53442300.bild.html">Bild</a></small></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Shipping:</b> Container ships, which also transport IT components across the world's oceans, emitted <b>932 million tons of CO₂</b> in 2015. <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/wasser/gewaesser/meere/nutzung-belastungen/schifffahrt#fakten-zur-seeschifffahrt-und-zu-ihren-auswirkungen-auf-die-umwelt">[Source: German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt), 2023]</a></li>
<li><b>Air Freight:</b> Particularly fast deliveries via aircraft are even more harmful to the climate—air transport generates about <b>180 times more CO₂ emissions per ton of freight than sea transport</b>. <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/dp201421.pdf">[Source: International Transport Forum, 2014]</a></li>
<li><b>Last Mile:</b> Delivery to end customers by truck or courier also contributes significantly to the CO₂ footprint, especially due to the growth in online retail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Measures such as shortening supply chains, using more energy-efficient means of transportation and regional production sites could significantly reduce these emissions.</p>

<h2 id="electrical-waste-the-unsolved-disposal-problem"><strong>Electrical waste: the unsolved disposal problem</strong></h2>

<p>Every year, over <strong>50 million tons of electronic waste</strong> are generated worldwide - less than 20% is recycled. IT devices contain valuable raw materials such as gold, copper and cobalt, but also hazardous substances that need to be disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Gold, Copper, and Cobalt:</b> Recycling can recover these materials for use in new products. For example, recycled gold is already being reused in smartphones, reducing the demand for newly mined gold. <a href="https://globalewastemonitor.org/">[Source: Global e-Waste Monitor, 2022]</a></li>
<li><b>Toxic Substances:</b> Many devices contain lead, mercury, and flame retardants, posing risks to both the environment and human health. Improperly disposed devices can leak these substances into groundwater, causing long-term damage to ecosystems. <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/35364/CoCL.pdf">[Source: UNEP, 2020]</a></li>
<li><b>Illegal Waste Disposal:</b> Old IT hardware is frequently exported to developing countries, where it is dismantled under hazardous conditions. According to research by the Basel Action Network (BAN), approximately <b>352,474 tons of electronic waste are illegally exported from Europe annually</b>, often disguised as recycling. In countries such as Ghana, massive e-waste dumps have emerged, where workers inhale toxic fumes without protective equipment, exposing them to severe health risks. <a href="https://wiki.ban.org/images/f/f4/Holes_in_the_Circular_Economy-_WEEE_Leakage_from_Europe.pdf">[Source: Basel Action Network, 2019]</a></li>

<h2 id="refurbished-hardware-and-the-circular-economy-keeping-resources-in-circulation"><strong>Refurbished hardware and the circular economy: keeping resources in circulation</strong></h2>

<p>One of the most effective measures for more sustainable IT is <strong>extending the lifespan of devices</strong>. Instead of replacing hardware after a few years, companies and consumers can rely on <strong>refurbished devices</strong> - professionally refurbished devices that are technically modernized and reused. This alternative not only reduces costs, but also the enormous <strong>resource consumption of new productions</strong>. In addition, the use of refurbished hardware can reduce <strong>CO₂ emissions, resource consumption and electronic waste by up to 80%</strong> compared to new devices. <a href="https://www.refurbed.de/a/pressrelease-refurbed-fraunhofer/">[Source: refurbed, 2024]</a> In addition to economic benefits, extending the service life of devices also helps to reduce e-waste, as fewer old devices need to be disposed of. Companies that rely on refurbished hardware not only benefit from lower acquisition costs, but also from positive sustainability effects that are reflected in their ESG balance sheet.</p>

<p>The circular economy** approach is even more consistent. The aim here is to keep <strong>IT devices, their components and materials in the usage cycle for as long as possible</strong> instead of disposing of them after a short time. Manufacturers must increasingly focus on <strong>modular, repairable designs</strong> and facilitate access to <strong>spare parts</strong>. Many components that are considered “obsolete” in the traditional IT value chain can still provide valuable services in other areas. One example: <strong>Servers</strong> decommissioned in data centers often find a second use as inexpensive, powerful machines in smaller companies. <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy-diagram">[Source: Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2023]</a></p>

<p>In addition, <strong>recycling can recover valuable raw materials such as gold, copper and rare earths</strong>, reducing the environmental impact of new extraction. <strong>Tech giants like Apple are already using recycled aluminum</strong> in their MacBooks, while Google aims to use only recycled materials in all of its hardware products by 2030 <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2024.pdf">[Source: Apple Environmental Progress Report, 2023]</a>; <a href="https://sustainability.google/reports/google-2023-environmental-report/">[Google Sustainability Report, 2023]</a>. However, <strong>consumers are also called upon</strong> to exploit the full impact of the circular economy: Those who consciously opt for <strong>long-lasting, repairable or refurbished devices</strong> actively contribute to the <strong>reduction of electronic waste and CO₂ emissions</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-a-more-sustainable-it"><strong>Ways to a more sustainable IT</strong></h2>

<p>Sustainability in IT requires a rethink along the entire life cycle of hardware and software. <strong>Longer usage times, targeted recycling and a consistent circular economy</strong> are key levers for conserving resources and reducing emissions. Companies and consumers alike can take responsibility - be it by purchasing long-lasting hardware, using refurbished devices or consciously handling electronic waste.</p>
