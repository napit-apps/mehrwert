Through his clear and direct communication, he is always able to present problems and challenges, as well as successes and achievements in the teams. He is solution-oriented and helps teams to work on their issues independently, but he does not shy away from getting involved himself. I particularly appreciate his ability to find a good balance between customer orientation and adherence to principles. As a result, real best practices for the specific challenges of my organization could be developed."
