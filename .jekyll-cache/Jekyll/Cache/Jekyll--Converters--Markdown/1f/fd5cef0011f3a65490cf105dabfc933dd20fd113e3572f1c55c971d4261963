I"+<p>Marcel is a key performer in my department. Through his clear and direct communication, he is always able to present problems and challenges, as well as successes and achievements in the teams. He is solution-oriented and helps teams to work on their issues independently, but he does not shy away from getting involved himself. I particularly appreciate his ability to find a good balance between customer orientation and adherence to principles. As a result, real best practices for the specific challenges of my organization could be developed.</p>
