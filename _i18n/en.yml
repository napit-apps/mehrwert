  subtitle : "Lack of technical leadership"
  title : "As IT grows, so do the challenges."
  content : "<p><b>Without technical leadership, teams get lost in daily business.</b><br />Many companies get stuck: IT evolves inconsistently, technical debt increases, and strategic decisions are postponed – often because the CTO role is missing or overwhelmed.</p>
            <p><b>This doesn’t just cost time and money – it endangers future viability.</b><br />Without a clear technical vision, silos emerge, poor architectural decisions are made, and inefficient processes take root. The result: frustrated teams, delayed releases, missed market opportunities. Eventually, it’s too late for sustainable corrections.</p>
            <p><b>A Fractional CTO brings strategic leadership on demand.</b><br />As a Fractional CTO, I bring structure, clarity, and technical thinking into your organization – flexible, experienced, and focused on what matters. Together, we realign your IT: future-proof, impact-driven, and aligned with your business goals.</p>"

##################### FAQ #########################
cto_faq:
  title: "GOOD TO KNOW"
  subtitle: "Answers to the most important questions"
  item:
  - question: "What exactly does a Fractional CTO do?"
    answer: "I temporarily take over technical leadership – hands-on and strategic. This includes clear architectural decisions, clean team structures, and effective processes – until your tech team can deliver independently."

  - question: "How does the engagement begin?"
    answer: "With the CTO Quick Check (free), we review goals, context, and needs. If appropriate, a CTO Tech Audit follows with clear recommendations and priorities."

  - question: "Are you part of my team or an external advisor?"
    answer: "I work as part of your organization, not from a meta level. I take responsibility, make decisions, and coach your team toward sustainable independence."

  - question: "How long do you stay on board?"
    answer: "As long as it makes sense – typically between 2 and 9 months. Some projects end after the roadmap phase, others continue until successful scaling."

  - question: "We don’t have a big budget. Are there smaller packages?"
    answer: "Yes – especially for startups and NGOs, there are focused modules like the Tech Audit or targeted architecture and team reviews. Impact over volume."

  - question: "How do you differ from traditional IT consultancies?"
    answer: "I don’t bring PowerPoint slides – I bring implementation experience. I work on real systems, with real teams – and deliver measurable impact, not just strategic presence."

  - question: "How do you measure your success as CTO?"
    answer: "Success means: transparency, progress, and autonomy. I work with concrete KPIs – e.g., release cycles, bug rate, technical debt, or team satisfaction. What matters is: your team can deliver independently after I’m gone."

  title : "When complexity grows, decisions must become faster, safer, and better."
  content : "<p><b>Agile frameworks alone aren’t enough.</b><br />Many companies adopt agile methods – but the expected impact never materializes: decisions are slow, teams are overwhelmed, strategic goals remain vague. The problem rarely lies in the framework itself, but in the missing interplay between structure, leadership, and governance.</p>
            <p><b>This costs speed, trust, and strategic clarity.</b><br />When roles are unclear, leadership models are absent, or business and IT are misaligned, uncertainty and risk arise. Especially in complex organizations, you need a systemic view – not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p>

ac_faq:
  title: "GOOD TO KNOW"
  subtitle: "Answers to Key Decision Questions"
  item:
  - question: "What’s the actual impact of Agile Coaching on my team?"
    answer: "More predictability, better decisions, and reduced friction – that’s what our clients experience. The effects are often quickly felt: more clarity, more focus, better collaboration."

  - question: "How soon will we see results?"
    answer: "In most cases, teams see noticeable improvements within a few weeks – in planning, collaboration, or accountability. Long-term impact is built through ongoing coaching."

  - question: "How much internal effort is required?"
    answer: "It’s manageable and tailored to your setup. We usually start with just a few hours per week to create visible impact – without blocking your teams."

  - question: "How is this different from other Agile Coaches?"
    answer: "We take a business-first approach. It’s not about process for the sake of process – it’s about outcomes: better governance, better decisions, better results."

  - question: "What does the 'Green' in Green Agile Coaching mean?"
    answer: "'Green' stands for sustainable agility – ecological, organizational, and strategic. It’s not only about Green IT, but also about decisions that conserve resources, foster stability, and ensure long-term impact. Green Agile Coaching aligns business goals with sustainable principles – measurable, resilient, and future-oriented."

  - question: "What if it doesn’t work?"
    answer: "Then we adjust. Coaching is a learning process – for both sides. If there’s no visible impact, we prefer to stop early rather than drag it out."

  - question: "How do we get started?"
    answer: "Start with the free Quick Check. Together we’ll analyze your setup, bottlenecks, and potential – and provide a tailored proposal for the next steps."

  - question: "Remote or on-site?"
