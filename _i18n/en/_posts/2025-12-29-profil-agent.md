In many companies, it always starts the same way. A new project request comes in. Or a customer tender lands in the inbox. The topic is interesting, the requirements are manageable – but then the real challenge begins: **Which employees are actually the right fit for this project?**

Who has the relevant experience? Who is currently available? And who might even be underutilized, yet would be a perfect match in terms of skills?

Instead of clear answers, a tedious search often begins. Profiles are gathered, Excel sheets opened, old Word documents copied and adapted. A lot of knowledge exists – but not where it is needed at that moment.


## The Real Problem: Matching Takes Time

The core issue is rarely a lack of expertise, but rather a lack of overview. Skills, project experience, and roles are spread across different systems or documented only superficially. At the same time, there is often no clear connection to employees’ **utilization**.

This leads to two typical situations:

* Responses to tenders are delayed, even though suitable profiles exist within the company.
* Employees with available capacity remain unnoticed, while other teams are overloaded.

This is exactly where our **Profile Agent** comes into play.


## How We Do It: From Demand to the Right Profile

The Profile Agent connects multiple sources of information into a single, coherent process. The starting point is either a project tender or an internal project demand. This input is automatically analyzed and structured.

At the same time, the system accesses existing employee data – such as project descriptions, roles, skills, and timelines. Optionally, **utilization data** can also be integrated. This makes it possible to identify employees who are a strong skills match **and** currently have available capacity.

The result is automatically generated short profiles that are precisely tailored to the specific context – for internal project planning as well as for external tenders.


## Under the Hood: Structure Instead of Guesswork

From a technical perspective, the Profile Agent is based on a modular pipeline. A key component is **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

Existing employee profiles are stored as a searchable knowledge base in a vector database. Relevant experience is retrieved in a targeted manner and combined with the requirements of the tender. A language model then ensures that the result is a coherent, natural-sounding short profile.

In addition, the Profile Agent calculates a **match score** that transparently shows how well a person fits a given request. This makes decisions more traceable – without removing humans from the process.


## Adaptable to Context, Brand, and Language

Every organization communicates differently. That is why the generated profiles can be flexibly adapted – both to the company’s own corporate identity and to the **corporate identity and tone of the customer**. Language and writing style can also be adjusted as needed.

This results in profiles that not only fit from a technical perspective, but also integrate seamlessly into existing proposal and communication processes.


## Real Value in Everyday Work

The value of the Profile Agent becomes clear in day-to-day operations:

* faster responses to project and customer requests
* better use of existing skills and expertise
* greater transparency regarding skills and utilization
* consistent, high-quality profiles
* less manual coordination and less time spent searching

In short: **less effort, better matches.**


## No Talent Goes Unused

The Profile Agent follows a clear guiding principle: **No talent goes unused.** By structuring knowledge, making it accessible, and enabling context-aware use, it helps organizations match people to the right projects more effectively – efficiently, transparently, and sustainably.

The **Mehr.Wiki** follows the same goal of making knowledge available in a structured way and reducing recurring search and coordination efforts. Instead of isolated documents, it provides a central, searchable knowledge base.
