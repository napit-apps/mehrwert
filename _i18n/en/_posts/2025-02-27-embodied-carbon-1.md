In today's digital world, much revolves around software, data, and networking. However, behind every digital application lies a physical infrastructure: data centers, servers, networking technology, and end devices. While the focus is often on energy efficiency and renewable power sources, a significant environmental impact remains overlooked – *Embodied Carbon*.

## **What is Embodied Carbon?**

The term *Embodied Carbon* refers to the total CO₂ emissions generated throughout the lifecycle of an IT product – from raw material extraction to production, transportation, and disposal. Unlike *Operational Carbon*, which accounts for emissions from energy consumption during use, *Embodied Carbon* often constitutes the larger share of environmental impact.

For example: **Up to 98% of the total CO₂ emissions of a smartphone or laptop occur during manufacturing.** Similarly, the production of a server, depending on its configuration, **generates between 100 and 3,000 kilograms of CO₂ equivalents.** The **Embodied Carbon** accounts for approximately **75% of the total CO₂ emissions of a rack server.** In comparison: **A smartphone generates around 55 kilograms of CO₂ equivalents due to Embodied Carbon, while a laptop generates about 300 kilograms.** [(Source)](https://globalelectronicscouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/GEC_Climate_Change_SOSR_DRAFT_For_Public_Comment_1APR2021.pdf)

## **Why is Embodied Carbon So Relevant?**

The production of IT hardware is extremely resource- and energy-intensive. It requires the extraction and processing of rare materials such as cobalt, lithium, silicon, and gold. The environmental consequences are severe:

<ul>
<li><b>High energy consumption</b>: The production of microprocessors and other high-tech components requires vast amounts of electricity, often sourced from fossil fuels.</li>
<li><b>Resource exploitation</b>: The extraction of rare metals leads to environmental destruction, water pollution, and social issues in mining regions.</li>
<li><b>Short life cycles</b>: Rapidly changing technology trends result in shorter device lifespans – often replaced despite still being functional.</li>
</ul>

## **Ways to Reduce Embodied Carbon**

To mitigate the *Embodied Carbon* of IT hardware, several strategies are essential:

<ul>
<li><b>Extended device lifespan</b>: Repairs, upgrades, and prolonged usage of devices significantly improve their environmental balance.</li>
<li><b>Circular economy</b>: Companies should focus on reuse and recycling to recover raw materials and reduce the need for new production.</li>
<li><b>Sustainable manufacturing</b>: Manufacturers must develop lower-emission production processes and increase the use of recycled materials.</li>
<li><b>Conscious consumer behavior</b>: Users can contribute by making informed purchasing decisions and adopting sustainable IT strategies.</li>
</ul>

## **Conclusion**

While the IT industry has made great strides in reducing *Operational Carbon*, *Embodied Carbon* remains an often-overlooked factor. Businesses and consumers must recognize the full environmental impact and implement sustainable strategies to minimize CO₂ emissions throughout a product’s lifecycle.

**Sustainable IT does not begin when a device is powered on – it starts with its production.**

## **Outlook**

In the upcoming articles in this series, we will take a closer look at the environmental impact of hardware production and disposal. We will also look at the life cycle of data centers and analyze their environmental challenges and possible sustainable solutions.
