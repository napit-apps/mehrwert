As the climate crisis intensifies, the **energy consumption of the IT sector** is drawing increasing attention. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), severe impacts can only be mitigated through **immediate emission reductions**. IT plays a dual role: on the one hand, digitalization can help reduce emissions in other sectors (*green by IT*). On the other hand, the industry itself must become more sustainable (*green in IT*).

Software is at the center of this transformation—because **sustainable software is efficient software**. Every inefficient line of code creates not only technical but also **ecological debt**. Like technical debt, it can impair **long-term maintainability and efficiency**—but with the added impact on **real resources like electricity and CO₂**. The good news: no radical changes are needed—what matters most is a **sharpened awareness** and a few **targeted adjustments**. This article presents practical **Green Coding Patterns** that are easy to integrate into everyday development.

## Small Levers, Big Impact

Sustainable development doesn’t have to start with a complete overhaul. Often, **small everyday changes**—a different format here, a more conscious decision there—can lead to **measurable effects**. These adjustments act like **levers**: small in effort but large in impact. Many small decisions can significantly **reduce energy consumption across multiple levels**.

Changing behaviors step by step leads to a **new awareness**. What feels like an extra effort today can soon become the **new normal**. The following examples highlight such **small levers with big impact**—immediately applicable and effective for both the environment and system performance.

## Efficiency Through Reduced Computation

One of the first levers lies in the **code itself**: the less computational power an application requires, the less energy it consumes. **Avoiding unnecessary calculations** is a key lever—just as a fuel-efficient car uses less gas, efficient code uses less electricity. It's not about perfection, but about setting clear **priorities for resource use**.

* **Avoid unnecessary processes**: Does every click really need to trigger a new query? Does the entire DOM need to re-render? Smart event handling and caching can prevent excess computation.
* **Prefer simple data types**: Integer operations often use less energy than floating-point ones. Small changes in data handling can make a big difference.
* **Use precompiled resources**: Bundle and optimize scripts and assets before delivery to reduce computation on end devices.

## Transferring Data Efficiently

**Data traffic also consumes energy**—on end devices, in networks, and in data centers. The rule: the less, the better.

* **Transfer only necessary data**: Keep API responses and database queries focused on essentials.
* **Compress files**: Text and image files can often be reduced significantly in size without losing quality.
* **Use caching effectively**: Repeated data retrievals can be avoided by storing static content locally or on the server.

## Energy-Efficient Interfaces and UX

The **design of an application** directly influences its energy demand. **User-friendliness and resource efficiency** are not mutually exclusive—they go hand in hand.

* **Use images efficiently**: Lean formats like WebP and properly scaled media reduce file size and energy consumption.
* **Reduce animations**: Visual effects increase GPU usage, especially on mobile devices. Less is more.
* **Offer dark mode**: On OLED screens, a dark interface saves energy and improves accessibility.
* **Optimize loading times**: Faster loading not only saves energy but also improves user experience.

## Using Resources More Wisely

The **infrastructure** behind an application also holds potential for optimization. The goal is to **scale resources to actual needs**.

* **Scale based on demand**: Systems should automatically adapt to load and scale down during off-peak times.
* **Shut down unnecessary environments**: Development and test environments don't need to run 24/7.
* **Use serverless and containers**: These technologies help use hardware more efficiently.

## Carbon-Aware Coding

Not all electricity is equally green. CO₂ emissions per kilowatt-hour vary depending on the time of day and grid load—depending on whether **renewable sources like wind and solar** are feeding the grid or whether **fossil fuels** dominate. This is called **carbon intensity**, describing how much carbon dioxide is emitted per kilowatt-hour of electricity. **Carbon-aware coding** takes these variations into account.

* **Schedule intelligently**: Batch jobs or analyses can be timed to run during periods of **low grid load or lower CO₂ intensity**—for instance, when renewables are abundant. Tools like the Carbon Aware SDK or apps like StromGedacht help identify particularly green times in the grid mix.
* **Adapt to device states**: Applications should detect whether a device is in energy-saving mode and adjust their behavior accordingly.

## Measuring and Improving

**Sustainability needs metrics**. Only what is measured can be improved. A **realistic overview** of energy usage is the foundation for meaningful change.

* **Measure energy consumption**: There are various ways to track how much energy an application uses—through **runtime profiling** or **indirect indicators** like CPU load, runtime, or memory usage. While these proxies aren’t precise, they offer helpful insights. More detailed analysis can be done with specialized tools.
* **Use benchmarks**: Standardized metrics like the **Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)** make progress measurable. A practical example is available in the [previous article on energy analysis with Powermetrics](https://mehrwert.tech/en/powermetrics).

## Low Hanging Fruits: Saving Energy on Devices

Not all optimization happens in code or infrastructure—**devices themselves** offer opportunities for simple yet effective actions:

* **Activate dark mode**: Especially on OLED screens, this can significantly reduce power usage.
* **Reduce screen brightness**: One of the simplest ways to save energy.
* **Shut down devices after hours**: Turning off monitors, laptops, and peripherals avoids unnecessary standby power.
* **Enable energy-saving modes**: Many operating systems and IDEs offer these features—they're often just unused.
* **Close unused tabs and applications**: Less load on the CPU means less energy consumed.

**These small, easy-to-implement actions** complement structural improvements and make **Green Coding** a **holistic approach**.

**One major advantage:** Many of these actions can be implemented **individually**, **without team consensus or lengthy discussions**. Anyone adjusting local power settings or activating energy-saving features can **have an immediate impact**. A portion of the **responsibility**—and **freedom to act**—lies in one’s own hands.

## Conclusion: Small Steps, Big Difference

**Green Coding doesn’t have to be complex.** Many practices are simple to implement and deliver real impact. **Efficient code**, **reduced data transfer**, and **thoughtful interfaces** help lower energy consumption while making software more **performant and reliable**.

**Developers have the power** to make software more sustainable—one line at a time.
