As the climate crisis intensifies, the IT sector's energy consumption is coming under increasing scrutiny. According to the IPCC, immediate emission reductions are essential to avoid the worst impacts. IT plays a dual role: on the one hand, digitalization can reduce emissions in other sectors (*green by IT*), while on the other hand, the industry itself must become more sustainable (*green in IT*).

Software is at the heart of this transition—because sustainable software is efficient software. Every inefficient line of code creates both technical and environmental “debt.” The good news? Radical changes aren’t always necessary. What matters is awareness and a few smart decisions. This article presents practical Green Coding Patterns that can be easily integrated into your daily development work.

## Small Levers, Big Impact

Sustainable development doesn't have to start with a complete rethink. Often, small changes—choosing a different format here, a more conscious decision there—can lead to noticeable savings. These adjustments reduce energy consumption at many levels.

Step by step, new habits form. What may feel like an extra task today can quickly become the new normal. The following examples are small levers with a big impact—easy to apply and effective for both the environment and system performance.

## Optimizing Code Efficiency

One of the first levers is in your code. The less processing power your app needs, the less energy it consumes. It's not about maximum performance—but about avoiding waste.

* **Avoid unnecessary processes:** Do you really need to fetch new data on every click? Does the whole DOM need to re-render? Thoughtful event handling and caching can reduce load significantly.
* **Prefer simple data types:** Integer operations usually require less energy than floating-point calculations. Small tweaks can have a big effect.
* **Precompile resources:** Bundle scripts and optimize assets before delivery to reduce the load on end devices.

Efficient code is like a fuel-efficient car—it gets the job done with less energy.

## Transmitting Data Efficiently

Data transfer consumes energy—on user devices, in networks, and in data centers. Keep it lean:

* **Send only what’s needed:** Remove unnecessary fields in API responses. Query only essential database columns.
* **Use compression and modern formats:** Compress text files and use formats like WebP or AVIF for images and videos.
* **Use caching:** Repeated requests can be avoided when static content is stored locally or server-side.

## Energy-Efficient Interfaces and UX

The design of your interface also affects energy consumption. Thoughtful, user-centered design and resource awareness go hand in hand.

* **Use optimized images:** Choose efficient formats like WebP and deliver images in the size needed—no larger.
* **Minimize animations:** Visual effects increase GPU load, especially on mobile devices. Use animations sparingly.
* **Offer dark mode:** OLED displays use significantly less power with dark backgrounds. A dark mode improves both energy efficiency and accessibility.
* **Minimize load times:** Faster pages save energy and improve the user experience.

## Use Infrastructure Responsibly

Energy isn’t just used on the front end. Infrastructure also offers major opportunities to reduce impact.

* **Scale with demand:** Use auto-scaling to reduce server activity during low-traffic periods.
* **Avoid overprovisioning:** Spin up dev and test environments only when needed.
* **Use containers and serverless:** These models reduce idle time and optimize hardware usage.

## Carbon-Aware Coding

Electricity isn’t always green—its carbon intensity depends on when and where it’s consumed.

* **Schedule intelligently:** Run non-urgent tasks at times of low grid emissions. A practical tool for this is the [Carbon Aware SDK](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk).
* **Adapt to device states:** Apps can respond to energy-saving modes or battery status to adjust behavior accordingly.

## Measure and Improve

Sustainability requires metrics. You can only improve what you measure.

* **Track energy usage:** Tools like CodeCarbon or Scaphandre allow you to monitor energy consumption during runtime.
* **Use benchmarks:** The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) metric helps assess and track progress. A real-life example is available in [this article on energy profiling with Powermetrics](https://mehrwert.tech/powermetrics).

## Low Hanging Fruits: Energy Tips for Devices

Not every improvement has to be in the code. Here are some easy actions you can take right at your workstation:

* **Use dark mode:** Especially useful on OLED screens.
* **Lower screen brightness:** Every small reduction helps.
* **Shut down devices overnight:** Avoid unnecessary standby energy use.
* **Activate energy saver modes:** Both operating systems and IDEs often offer these.
* **Close unused apps and browser tabs:** Reduces CPU load and energy consumption.

These quick wins support your technical improvements and make green coding part of your everyday routine.

## Conclusion: Small Steps, Big Difference

Green coding doesn’t have to be difficult. Many changes are easy to implement—and they bring real benefits. More efficient code, less data, and smarter UI design not only lower energy use but also make your software more performant and reliable.

As developers, we have the power to build a more sustainable digital world—one line at a time.
