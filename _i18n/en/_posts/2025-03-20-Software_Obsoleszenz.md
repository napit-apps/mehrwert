In the IT world, a device's lifespan is not determined solely by hardware quality—**software plays a crucial role** as well. Many hardware components are discarded today even though they are still technically functional. The reason? Modern software places ever **higher demands on processors, memory, and other resources**. Industry analyses show that increasing software requirements drive hardware replacements more than pure technological innovation. This dynamic has significant implications for companies aiming to manage their IT infrastructure **efficiently, cost-effectively, and sustainably**.

## Software as the Key to Hardware Longevity

Software largely determines **how long hardware remains usable**. Functional hardware is often **replaced prematurely** because rising software demands make it obsolete—a phenomenon known as **software obsolescence**. As the technological gap between hardware generations narrows, software—not hardware innovation—has become the primary driver of increasing electronic waste. Lack of software support or compatibility with newer programs renders older devices practically useless, even when the hardware is still functional. This form of software-driven aging leads to hardware being discarded before reaching its full technical lifespan. Moreover, it makes **refurbishment options less attractive or even impossible**, as older devices can no longer be effectively reused due to compatibility issues with modern software.

## Consequences and Challenges

**Software obsolescence** forces companies to **replace hardware more frequently**, increasing investment costs and contradicting sustainability goals. According to a study by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), extending the lifespan of computers by just one year could reduce the environmental impact of these devices by approximately 25%. [[EEB, 2019]](https://eeb.org/revealed-the-climate-cost-of-disposable-smartphones/) Manufacturers must design software, products, and services to ensure **long-term support and compatibility**, allowing hardware to remain in use for longer periods.

## Strategies for Extending Hardware Lifespan

Companies can extend the lifespan of their hardware through conscious decisions in software development and selection. It is essential to prioritize software products whose vendors guarantee **long-term support (LTS) versions**. This reduces the need for frequent hardware replacements while ensuring prolonged usability. Products that utilize **open interfaces and standard formats** enable better integration with older systems and offer long-term flexibility for software updates and modifications. To help customers make informed decisions, vendors must provide **transparent communication** regarding product support duration, hardware requirements, and long-term compatibility.

A recent example is the Google Pixel 9, which has been announced with guaranteed security updates until at least October 2033. Additionally, Google has clearly communicated the hardware specifications necessary for long-term usage. [[Heise, 2025]](https://www.heise.de/news/Pixel-9a-Googles-Antwort-auf-das-Apple-iPhone-16e-10321170.html) This transparency allows businesses to plan their IT infrastructure more reliably.

Furthermore, software updates should not artificially degrade older hardware performance through intentional slowdowns or exclusion from new versions. **Transparent and fair update strategies** promote longer hardware lifecycles. The use of **open-source software** also extends hardware lifespan, as the community continuously develops and adapts solutions for older devices. Companies should also plan hardware upgrades **based on actual needs**, utilizing modern monitoring tools to assess performance accurately and prevent unnecessary investments.

### Development of Security Updates for Smartphones

The chart illustrates the increasing length of guaranteed security updates for iPhone and Google Pixel models over recent years. This trend is highly positive, as extended update periods improve device usability and security. Businesses and users must now adapt to these improved and more sustainable usage cycles and adjust their IT strategies accordingly.

## How Software Developers Can Promote Hardware Longevity

Software developers play a crucial role in extending hardware lifespan. **Resource-efficient programming** helps by optimizing algorithms, minimizing background processes, and reducing memory usage. Particularly memory-intensive tasks or unnecessary graphical effects should be optional and adjustable to avoid excessive strain on older hardware. Developers should also ensure **long-term compatibility** by regularly testing software on older hardware generations and operating systems.

Supporting **backward compatibility** is essential, ensuring that updates do not exclude older devices. Applications should be designed in a modular and scalable way so that resource-intensive features are only activated if the hardware can handle them. This allows users with older devices to continue enjoying a good user experience without being forced to upgrade. Each new feature should be critically evaluated for its actual value, as unnecessary additions can significantly burden hardware.

Additionally, developers should adopt **sustainable update strategies**, separating security updates from feature enhancements. This allows users to keep older devices secure without being forced to install resource-heavy new functionalities. Whenever possible, developers should use **open standards and open-source components** to ensure long-term software maintenance by the community.

## Benefits of Extending Hardware Lifespan

Extending hardware lifespan offers clear advantages for businesses. It leads to **significant cost savings**, as fewer hardware purchases ease IT budgets while reducing maintenance, setup, and disposal costs. Sustainable IT practices contribute to less electronic waste, lower resource consumption, and an improved carbon footprint, strengthening a company’s environmental reputation. Additionally, **competitive advantages** arise as sustainable IT strategies enhance corporate image and increase customer loyalty, especially as more consumers and partners prioritize ecological responsibility.

## Conclusion

By managing software requirements wisely and implementing strategic software development approaches, businesses can significantly extend hardware lifespan. This leads to financial benefits while making a meaningful contribution to environmental sustainability. Given the substantial environmental impact of hardware production—also known as **embodied carbon** (more on this in our article series on [[**Embodied Carbon**]](https://mehrwert.tech/en/embodied-carbon-1))—extending hardware lifespan is essential.

Software developers and companies can further contribute through **Green Coding**, which promotes sustainable software practices. Our introductory guide to [[**Green Coding**]](https://mehrwert.tech/en/green-coding) explores initial approaches to this. The responsibility ultimately lies with manufacturers, developers, and businesses to make sustainable IT decisions that foster long-term, efficient, and resource-conscious infrastructure usage.
