## Video Conferencing Tools Compared: How Much Energy Do Zoom, Teams, and FaceTime Really Use?

Video conferencing has become an integral part of our everyday lives. But how climate-friendly are tools like Zoom, Teams, and FaceTime really? In a self-experiment, all three tools were tested under identical conditions – with some surprising results.

This wasn’t just about the tools themselves, but also about a central question: Can the energy consumption of digital applications be measured and compared with simple methods? The answer is: **Yes.** Using the built-in **powermetrics** tool available on every Mac and some scripting in **Python**, a realistic test setup was created. It shows that even without expensive hardware or specialized software, meaningful energy comparisons are possible. The experiment proves that solid insights into energy efficiency can be achieved in a **low-threshold and reproducible** way – an important aspect for IT professionals who take sustainability seriously in their digital infrastructure.

## Setup and Objective

The self-experiment was conducted in **June/July 2023** on a **MacBookPro17,1 running macOS Ventura Version 13.3**. Only the energy consumption on the device itself was considered – meaning the energy demand of each application on the MacBook, excluding network usage or external infrastructure. The three widely used video conferencing tools **Zoom**, **Microsoft Teams**, and **FaceTime** were tested. The goal was to examine how incoming and outgoing video and screen sharing impact energy consumption – and whether recommendations for more sustainable usage can be derived.

At the same time, the experiment aimed to demonstrate that tools like **powermetrics**, a **Python script**, and a well-designed test setup can already be used to make qualitative statements about energy efficiency.

## Methodology

Each tool was tested in various scenarios: **incoming video on/off, outgoing video on/off, and screen sharing on/off**. The so-called **Energy Impact** was recorded – a model value generated by powermetrics and saved as a text file. A **restart** was performed before each measurement series to terminate unnecessary processes. Additionally, a **baseline** was established by modeling the Energy Impact after a restart with no programs open.

Measurements were conducted in **10-minute blocks**. Each scenario was repeated **three times**, and the **average Energy Impact** was calculated.

The analysis script was written in **Python**: relevant data was extracted using **regex**, transferred to a **Pandas DataFrame**, and **visualized**.

The test setup was intentionally kept **realistic**: video calls were conducted between two laptops. An external display showed a standardized test video with audio, which was recorded by the MacBook's camera. This ensured that all scenarios were **consistent and reproducible**.

## Results Overview

The two charts below clearly show the average Energy Impact of the tested video conferencing tools in two groups of scenarios: with and without screen sharing. This makes it easy to visually compare the energy profiles of the applications.

The results reveal clear differences between the tools – especially with screen sharing and active video. **Microsoft Teams** performed **worse in almost all scenarios** compared to Zoom and FaceTime. Only in the **minimal mode without video or screen sharing** were the results across all tools relatively similar.

These data clearly show: **The choice of tool and video conference configuration has a direct impact on energy consumption.** Especially for regular meetings, it’s worth being mindful about camera and screen sharing behavior – particularly when using Teams.

A particularly revealing comparison is between the "everything off" and "everything on" scenarios. While FaceTime and Zoom showed almost identical values with only incoming or outgoing video compared to the "everything off" scenario, Microsoft Teams showed a dramatic difference: **Energy Impact increased by a factor of 80** when all features – incoming and outgoing video and screen sharing – were enabled. In comparison: FaceTime's consumption only increased by about **a factor of five**, Zoom by **a factor of three**. This not only highlights the technical efficiency of each platform, but also the immense potential for optimization through conscious use.

In the scenario with all features enabled (**"Video in/out + screen sharing on"**), the **Energy Impact for Teams was about three times higher** than in minimal mode with everything disabled – a significant difference that adds up over time.

## Conclusion: Understanding Energy Use – A Foundation for Sustainable Software

The self-experiment shows **just how wide the differences in energy consumption** between video conferencing tools can be. Even with **basic built-in tools**, **meaningful results** can be achieved. This approach makes it possible to **gradually engage with the complex topic of software energy efficiency** – without immediately needing specialized measurement equipment or large resources.

The insights gained provide a **solid foundation** for evaluating software in terms of energy efficiency – and build a bridge to the **Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) standard**, which focuses on the **transparent measurement and optimization of CO₂ emissions from software**.

**With the right tool and more conscious usage, even everyday applications can be used more sustainably.**
