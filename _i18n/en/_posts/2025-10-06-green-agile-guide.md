A few years ago, I was asked to analyze the enterprise resource planning system of a major German supermarket chain. The system had evolved over decades — written in *Gupta*, a development environment that’s barely used today. One single file contained more than **300,000 lines of source code**. No modular structure. No documentation. No clear ownership.

No one really knew **what** the system was doing, **why** it worked the way it did — or **what would break** if even a minor change was made.

What followed wasn’t optimization — it was a complete rewrite. A multi-year project that demanded enormous resources: technically, economically, and humanly.

For me, this was a turning point. Because it showed me that sustainability in IT doesn’t start with energy measurements — it starts with **awareness and responsibility**.

## Green Agile Starts With Values

In the [Green Agile Guide](https://greenagile.org), we often talk about sustainable practices: impact transparency, a green product backlog, ecological architecture decisions. But all of these methods are ineffective if they aren’t built on a **foundation of values**.

That’s why we’ve placed two guiding principles at the core of the guide:

### Awareness

- Understanding what software really *does* — technically, ecologically, socially  
- Having the courage to name **blind spots** in teams and processes  
- Seeing systems in context: Who uses them? What do they really need? What costs arise in 2, 5, or 10 years?

> Awareness means not just optimizing locally — but thinking globally.

### Responsibility

- Making decisions even when they’re uncomfortable or more expensive short-term  
- Naming technical debt — instead of ignoring it  
- Taking long-term maintainability seriously  
- Not delegating sustainability — but **owning it as part of your role**

> Responsibility means taking action — even when no one is watching.

## Why It's More Than Just Technology

Many companies today invest in sustainability initiatives — from green coding to CO₂ compensation. That’s important. But without **internalized values**, it often remains symbolic.

Sustainability needs a culture in which people say:
> “I understand what I’m doing — and I stand by the impact of my work.”

That’s where Green Agile comes in. It’s not about new roles or checklists. It’s about bringing **a new mindset** into existing processes.

## What Can You Do?

Here are some questions you can ask yourself — or your team:

- Where are we missing **transparency** — technically or organizationally?  
- Who is **truly responsible** — not just formally, but in reality?  
- What decisions would we make differently if we thought **more long-term**?

## What’s Next

Over the next few weeks, I’ll share more elements of the Green Agile Guide in a short blog series — from practical techniques to role models and meaningful metrics. If you’re interested in applying the guide in your organization or contributing your thoughts, I’d love to hear from you.

> Together, we can prove: **Sustainable software doesn't happen by accident. It’s built by people with awareness and responsibility.**

The **Green Agile** article takes up this perspective as well and shows how efficiency, structure, and conscious decision-making interact in agile contexts. You can read more about this in the article [Green Agile – Designing Efficiency with Intent](https://mehrwert.tech/en/green-agile).
