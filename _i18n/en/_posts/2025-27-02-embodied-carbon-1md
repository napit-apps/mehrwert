In today's digital world, much revolves around software, data, and networking. However, behind every digital application lies a physical infrastructure: data centers, servers, networking technology, and end devices. While the focus is often on energy efficiency and renewable power sources, a significant environmental impact remains overlooked – *Embodied Carbon*.

## **What is Embodied Carbon?**

The term *Embodied Carbon* refers to the total CO₂ emissions generated throughout the lifecycle of an IT product – from raw material extraction to production, transportation, and disposal. Unlike *Operational Carbon*, which accounts for emissions from energy consumption during use, *Embodied Carbon* often constitutes the larger share of environmental impact.

For example: **Up to 98% of the total CO₂ emissions of a smartphone or laptop occur during manufacturing.** Similarly, the production of a server, depending on its configuration, **generates between 100 and 3,000 kilograms of CO₂ equivalents.** The **Embodied Carbon** accounts for approximately **75% of the total CO₂ emissions of a rack server.** In comparison: **A smartphone generates around 55 kilograms of CO₂ equivalents due to Embodied Carbon, while a laptop generates about 300 kilograms.** [(Source)](https://globalelectronicscouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/GEC_Climate_Change_SOSR_DRAFT_For_Public_Comment_1APR2021.pdf)

## **Why is Embodied Carbon So Relevant?**

The production of IT hardware is extremely resource- and energy-intensive. It requires the extraction and processing of rare materials such as cobalt, lithium, silicon, and gold. The environmental consequences are severe:

- **High energy consumption**: The production of microprocessors and other high-tech components requires vast amounts of electricity, often sourced from fossil fuels.
- **Resource exploitation**: The extraction of rare metals leads to environmental destruction, water pollution, and social issues in mining regions.
- **Short life cycles**: Rapidly changing technology trends result in shorter device lifespans – often replaced despite still being functional.

## **Ways to Reduce Embodied Carbon**

To mitigate the *Embodied Carbon* of IT hardware, several strategies are essential:

1. **Extended device lifespan**: Repairs, upgrades, and prolonged usage of devices significantly improve their environmental balance.
2. **Circular economy**: Companies should focus on reuse and recycling to recover raw materials and reduce the need for new production.
3. **Sustainable manufacturing**: Manufacturers must develop lower-emission production processes and increase the use of recycled materials.
4. **Conscious consumer behavior**: Users can contribute by making informed purchasing decisions and adopting sustainable IT strategies.

## **Conclusion**

While the IT industry has made great strides in reducing *Operational Carbon*, *Embodied Carbon* remains an often-overlooked factor. Businesses and consumers must recognize the full environmental impact and implement sustainable strategies to minimize CO₂ emissions throughout a product’s lifecycle.

**Sustainable IT does not begin when a device is powered on – it starts with its production.**
