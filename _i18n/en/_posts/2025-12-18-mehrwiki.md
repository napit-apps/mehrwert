Knowledge is one of the most valuable resources in companies—and at the same time one of the most transient. A colleague spends years acquiring in-depth expertise in projects, gathering experience, and developing best practices. But what happens when this knowledge only exists in presentations, local folders, or in her own head?

This is precisely where a central problem of modern knowledge work lies: skills are built up individually, but are often only available to the company as a whole to a limited extent. Project knowledge disappears into folder structures, insights are reworked multiple times, and valuable experience is lost as soon as teams change.

This is where **Mehr.Wiki** comes in: an internal knowledge database that captures and bundles precisely this knowledge and makes it accessible to everyone—in a sustainable, structured, and future-proof way.

## From individual knowledge to a shared resource

Mehr.Wiki is the internal knowledge platform of Mehr.Wert GmbH. Technically, it is based on MediaWiki, the open-source software that also underpins Wikipedia. However, it is not so much the technology that is important as the idea behind it: knowledge acquired by individual employees in projects, research, or training should not remain isolated. In Mehr.Wiki, it is stored in such a way that others can quickly find, understand, and reuse it—regardless of who originally developed it.

## What content is included in Mehr.Wiki?

Mehr.Wiki contains content from a wide variety of technical contexts—from technical questions and methodological approaches to organizational topics. It is important to note that we deliberately avoid long, newly written “wiki articles” unless necessary. Instead, existing materials are entered in an **accessible** manner and briefly classified.

These include, for example, PDFs, presentations, Excel files, worksheets, and training materials. This creates a **uniformly structured** knowledge base from different sources that can be quickly used in everyday life.

## Structure instead of knowledge silos

A central principle of Mehr.Wiki is a clear structure and taxonomy—and a deliberately streamlined approach to content. Instead of writing long texts or extensive editorial articles, existing media and materials are integrated simply, pragmatically, and as close as possible to their original form.

Documents, presentations, or working materials are stored in such a way that they can be found quickly and are clearly organized without being unnecessarily reworked. Categories and subcategories ensure that content is grouped thematically on overview pages.

The result: less maintenance, less duplication of work, and more transparency about what knowledge already exists in the company—and where it can be found.

In knowledge management in particular, it is clear time and again that **less is often more**. It is not the number of functions or perfectly crafted content that determines the success of a system, but its usability in everyday life. Low-threshold access, clear structures, and carefully selected, easily available tools lower the barrier to use – and ensure that knowledge is actually shared and developed further. This is precisely where the key to sustainable knowledge management lies.

### AI-supported assistance with knowledge processing

To ensure that data entry remains fast, the tools used are embedded in a separate routine that serves as a **content intake pipeline**. This pipeline maps the entire process from reading and processing to storage in the wiki and makes it possible to collect and efficiently enter multiple documents.

We integrate **commercially available API solutions** for content processing: documents are analyzed automatically and provided with a **short, compact summary**. This mini-summary serves as an “introduction” so that colleagues can decide in seconds whether a document is relevant to them.

In this way, AI modules primarily support structure and orientation—not the rewriting of entire content. This keeps the effort low and makes knowledge management realistic in everyday work.

## Robust, sustainable, and expandable

The most important sustainability factor of Mehr.Wiki is its **suitability for everyday use**: new content can be quickly added, updated, and sensibly categorized—without any major hurdles. It is precisely this low threshold that ensures that the wiki is actually used and continuously maintained, rather than becoming obsolete after a one-time “documentation phase.”

We support this technically through containerized operation. Existing content is retained during updates or restarts, and typical sources of error—such as special characters in file names or uploads that are too large—are reliably detected and communicated transparently. This ensures that Mehr.Wiki remains stable, expandable, and usable in the long term.

## Looking ahead


The **Green Agile Guide** follows a similar approach: it shows how efficiency, structure, and conscious decision-making can be combined in agile ways of working.
