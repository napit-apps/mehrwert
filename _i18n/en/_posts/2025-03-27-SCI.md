Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword – it's becoming increasingly relevant in software development. As we've already explored in our [previous article](https://mehrwert.tech/en/software-bsoleszenz), software decisions can significantly impact the lifespan of hardware. In addition, software consumes energy and thus indirectly contributes to CO₂ emissions. The **Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)** standard helps companies and developers make these emissions visible – and therefore optimizable.

## What is Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)?

SCI makes the environmental impact of software measurable. Developed by the Green Software Foundation, the standard offers a clear methodology for estimating and reducing CO₂ emissions in software. The goal: to create an objective foundation for making software more sustainable.

## How SCI Works

SCI measures emissions caused both during operation and in the creation of software. This includes energy consumption, hardware efficiency, and the carbon intensity of the energy used. Developers get actionable insights into where to optimize in order to reduce emissions.

The core formula of SCI is:

In this formula, *E* stands for the energy consumed by the software (in kWh), *I* for the amount of CO₂ emitted per kWh of energy consumed, and *M* for the embodied carbon. More about what embodied carbon means and how it is measured can be found in our article series on [Embodied Carbon](https://mehrwert.tech/en/embodied-carbon-1). The factor *R* puts these emissions into context – per user, per system hour, per access, or another suitable reference depending on the specific use case and data availability. In Germany, the average value for *I* in 2023 was 380 g CO₂/kWh (Umweltbundesamt, 2023). More values and country-specific data can be found on [electricityMaps](https://app.electricitymaps.com/) or via the [IEA](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-browser?country=WORLD\&fuel=Energy%20consumption\&indicator=Electricity%20generation%20by%20source).

A practical example of measuring energy consumption is estimating it based on CPU and RAM usage. Alternatively, network traffic, the number and type of running processes, or standardized benchmarks can serve as a proxy. What matters is transparency – the chosen method should be documented and traceable. A physical power meter isn't necessarily required; tools like Apple’s "powermetrics" already offer reliable, scriptable insights into hardware utilization.

## An Internationally Recognized ISO Standard

Since 2024, SCI has been officially recognized as an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 21031:2024). It defines clear criteria and methods for transparently tracking and reporting the carbon footprint of software. This gives SCI international legitimacy and makes it easier to implement across the industry. Companies benefit from a globally accepted framework for consistent and reliable sustainability metrics.

## Measuring is Winning

SCI allows companies to compare the ecological efficiency of different software solutions and choose more sustainable options. Developers can integrate the methodology into their development process, resulting in more resource-efficient products in the long run (Green Software Foundation Projects, 2024). Clear metrics are essential: you can only improve what you can measure. SCI provides the data needed to bring sustainability from theory into practice.

## Challenges and Criticism

Naturally, introducing a new standard comes with challenges. Accurate measurements rely on high-quality data, which can be time-consuming to gather. To make SCI effective, it must now be applied in real-world scenarios with concrete use cases. Even rough estimates can spark improvement and highlight the biggest levers for reducing emissions.

## Conclusion

The Software Carbon Intensity standard sets new benchmarks in sustainable software development. With clear and measurable outcomes, it enables developers and organizations to actively reduce emissions. Now it's up to the industry to embrace this standard and drive real change for a more sustainable digital future.
